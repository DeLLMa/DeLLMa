    "decision": "action 3. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a consistent upward trend over the last year, indicating strong momentum. from december 2022 to november 2023, meta's price increased from 117.96 to 328.49 dollars per share, which is a significant rise. this suggests that the stock has been performing well and may continue to do so in the short term. in contrast, dis and googl have shown less significant growth or more fluctuation in their prices, and nvda, despite a high current price, has shown a slight decrease from the previous month. given the budget of 10000 dollars and the goal to maximize profit by the end of december 2023, investing in meta appears to be the most promising option due to its strong recent performance and growth trajectory. it is important to note that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and this recommendation is based solely on historical price trends without considering other external factors that could impact stock performance."
