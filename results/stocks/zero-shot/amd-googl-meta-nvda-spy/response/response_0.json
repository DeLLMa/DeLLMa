    "decision": "action 3. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a consistent upward trend over the last year, indicating strong momentum. from november 2022 to november 2023, meta's price increased from 106.40 to 328.49 dollars per share, which is a significant rise. this suggests that the stock has been recovering well after a dip in 2022. given this positive trend, it is reasonable to expect that meta could continue to perform well in december 2023. additionally, the holiday season could potentially boost advertising revenue for meta platforms, which could positively impact the stock price. while past performance is not indicative of future results, the recent trend and potential seasonal effects make meta a strong candidate for purchase. the other stocks, while they may also have potential, do not show as strong a growth trend as meta does in the same time frame. therefore, with the goal of maximizing profit within the given timeframe, investing the 10000 dollars in meta appears to be the most promising option."
