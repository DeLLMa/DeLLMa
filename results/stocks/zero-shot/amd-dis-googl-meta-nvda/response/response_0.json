    "decision": "action 4. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta (meta platforms, formerly known as facebook) has shown a significant upward trend in the past year, moving from a price of $117.96 in december 2022 to $328.49 in november 2023. this represents an increase of approximately 178% over the 12-month period. in contrast, the other stocks have shown either less growth or a decline in the same period. for instance, amd has increased from $68.09 to $117.59, dis has decreased from $90.83 to $90.37, googl has increased from $92.32 to $133.38, and nvda has increased from $162.12 to $475.31. while nvda has also shown substantial growth, the price per share is much higher, which means fewer shares can be purchased with the $10,000 budget, potentially limiting the total profit due to less volume. given the strong momentum and the more affordable share price of meta, it is expected that it may continue to perform well in the short term, potentially providing a higher return by the end of december 2023. therefore, the recommendation is to invest the $10,000 in meta."
