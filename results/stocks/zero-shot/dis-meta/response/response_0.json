    "decision": "action 2. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta stock has shown a significant upward trend over the last year, moving from a price of 117.96 dollars in december 2022 to 328.49 dollars in november 2023. this represents an increase of approximately 178% over the 12-month period. in contrast, dis stock has shown a downward trend over the same period, moving from 90.83 dollars in december 2022 to 90.37 dollars in november 2023, which is a slight decrease. given the strong positive momentum of meta stock compared to the relatively stagnant performance of dis stock, it is reasonable to expect that meta may continue to perform well in the short term. therefore, investing the 10000 dollars in meta stock is recommended as it has a higher potential for profit based on recent historical performance. however, it is important to note that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and other factors such as market conditions, company news, and broader economic indicators should also be considered before making an investment decision."
