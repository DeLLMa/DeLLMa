    "decision": "action 4. nvda: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, nvda (nvidia) has shown a significant upward trend over the last 24 months, with the price increasing from $299.31 in december 2021 to $465.25 in december 2023. this represents a substantial growth in value. the other stocks, amd, dis, and googl, have not shown the same level of growth within the same period. amd and googl have shown some recovery from their lows, but not as dramatically as nvda. dis has been relatively flat with a slight uptick in the recent month. given the strong momentum and growth of nvda, it is likely to provide a better return by the end of december 2023, assuming the trend continues and there are no significant market disruptions or company-specific negative news. therefore, investing $10,000 in nvda seems to be the most promising option to maximize profit by the end of the month, based on historical performance."
