    "decision": "action 4. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a consistent upward trend over the last year, indicating strong momentum. from december 2022 to november 2023, meta's price increased from 117.96 to 328.49 dollars per share, which is a significant rise. this suggests that the company has been performing well and the market is responding positively to its developments. given this trend, it is reasonable to expect that meta's stock price may continue to rise in december 2023. additionally, with a current price of 325.48 dollars per share, your 10000 dollars would allow you to purchase approximately 30 shares (ignoring transaction fees and assuming full shares can be purchased), which could lead to a substantial profit if the stock price continues to increase at a similar rate. the other stocks, while they may also have potential, do not show the same level of consistent growth over the past year as meta does. therefore, based on the historical data and the recent strong performance of meta, it is recommended to invest in meta with the aim of maximizing profit by the end of december 2023."
