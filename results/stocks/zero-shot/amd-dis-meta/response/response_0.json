    "decision": "action 3. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a significant upward trend in the last year, moving from a low of 106.40 in november 2022 to 328.49 in november 2023. this represents an increase of over 200 dollars per share in a year, indicating strong momentum. in contrast, amd and dis have shown more modest increases or fluctuations in their stock prices over the same period. amd's price increased from 69.61 in november 2022 to 117.59 in november 2023, and dis's price increased from 96.48 in november 2022 to 90.37 in november 2023, which is actually a decrease. given the strong performance and upward trend of meta's stock, it is reasonable to expect that this momentum may continue into december 2023, potentially providing a higher return on investment compared to the other options. therefore, the recommendation is to invest the 10000 dollars in meta. however, it is important to note that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and this recommendation does not take into account other factors that may affect stock prices, such as market conditions, economic indicators, company performance, and news events that have occurred after the knowledge cutoff date. investors should also consider their own risk tolerance and perform due diligence before making investment decisions."
