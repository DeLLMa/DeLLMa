    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, nvda (nvidia) has shown a significant upward trend over the last 24 months, with the price increasing from $299.31 in december 2021 to $465.25 in december 2023. this represents a substantial growth in value. in contrast, amd and googl have shown less dramatic growth or more fluctuation in their stock prices over the same period. amd's price increased from $143.49 to $119.88, and googl's price decreased from $145.15 to $131.86. given the strong momentum of nvda's stock and its recent historical performance, it is expected that nvda may continue to perform well in the short term. therefore, investing $10,000 in nvda could potentially yield a higher return by the end of december 2023 compared to the other options. however, it is important to note that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and stock prices can be influenced by a wide range of factors including market conditions, company performance, and broader economic trends. investors should also consider the current valuation and market sentiment before making a decision."
