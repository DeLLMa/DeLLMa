    "decision": "action 4. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a consistent upward trend over the last year, indicating a strong recovery from its low in 2022-11. the price has increased from 106.40 dollars in 2022-11 to 328.49 dollars in 2023-11. this represents a significant increase and suggests a positive momentum that could continue into the end of 2023. additionally, the price of meta at the end of the previous year (2022-12) was 117.96 dollars, and it increased to 137.25 dollars by 2023-01, showing a historical pattern of growth from december to january. if this pattern holds, we could expect a similar increase at the end of 2023. given the strong performance and the historical end-of-year growth, meta seems to be the most promising stock for maximizing profit within the given timeframe. the other stocks, amd, dis, and gme, have not shown as strong a growth trend as meta in the recent months leading up to december 2023. therefore, investing the 10000 dollars in meta appears to be the most strategic decision for potential profit maximization by the end of december 2023."
