    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, nvda has shown a significant upward trend over the last 24 months, with the price increasing from $299.31 in december 2021 to $465.25 in december 2023. this represents a growth of approximately 55.5% over the two-year period. in contrast, spy has shown a more modest increase from $466.41 in december 2021 to $455.77 in december 2023, which is actually a slight decrease of about 2.3%. nvda's growth trajectory suggests a stronger momentum, which could potentially lead to higher returns by the end of december 2023. additionally, nvda's price increased from $436.35 in october 2023 to $475.31 in november 2023 before slightly decreasing to $465.25 in december 2023, indicating recent volatility that could present opportunities for profit if the pattern of a sharp increase followed by a slight decrease continues. on the other hand, spy's price movement has been less volatile and has not shown the same level of growth potential in recent months. therefore, based on historical performance and recent price trends, investing in nvda appears to have a higher potential for profit maximization by the end of december 2023."
