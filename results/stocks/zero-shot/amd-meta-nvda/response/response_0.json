    "decision": "action 2. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta (meta platforms) shows a strong upward trend in the last year, moving from a low of 106.40 in november 2022 to 328.49 in november 2023. this represents an increase of over 200 dollars per share in one year, which is a significant growth rate. in contrast, amd has shown growth but less consistently, and nvda, while also showing growth, has a much higher current price which would result in fewer shares purchased with the 10000 dollar budget. given the strong momentum of meta and the fact that its current price is slightly below the previous month's price, it suggests a potential for rebound and continued growth. therefore, investing in meta could potentially yield a higher return by the end of december 2023, assuming the trend continues. it's important to note that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and this recommendation does not take into account other factors such as market conditions, company performance, and broader economic indicators that could affect stock prices."
