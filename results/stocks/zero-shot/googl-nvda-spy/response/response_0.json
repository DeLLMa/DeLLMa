    "decision": "action 2. nvda: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, nvda (nvidia) has shown a significant upward trend over the last 24 months, with the price increasing from $299.31 in december 2021 to $465.25 in december 2023. this represents a growth of approximately 55.5% over the two-year period. in contrast, googl (alphabet) and spy (s&p 500) have shown less growth or even a decrease in price over the same period. googl has decreased from $145.15 to $131.86, and spy has decreased from $466.41 to $455.77. given the strong momentum and growth trajectory of nvda, it is likely to offer a higher potential for profit if this trend continues through the end of december 2023. additionally, nvda's price has increased from $436.35 in october 2023 to $475.31 in november 2023 before slightly decreasing to $465.25 in december 2023, indicating recent volatility that could be leveraged for profit if the price rebounds by the end of the month as it did from october to november. therefore, with a budget of $10,000, purchasing nvda shares appears to be the most promising option for maximizing profit by the end of december 2023."
