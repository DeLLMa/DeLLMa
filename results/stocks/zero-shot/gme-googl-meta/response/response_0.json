    "decision": "action 3. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a consistent upward trend over the last year, moving from a price of 117.96 dollars in december 2022 to 328.49 dollars in november 2023. this represents a significant increase in value, suggesting strong performance and potential for continued growth. in contrast, gme has shown a downward trend, decreasing from 21.54 dollars in december 2022 to 13.15 dollars in november 2023. googl has shown some recovery from its lowest point in december 2022 at 92.32 dollars to 133.38 dollars in november 2023, but this increase is not as pronounced as meta's. given the strong upward momentum of meta and the budget of 10000 dollars, investing in meta could potentially yield the highest return by the end of december 2023, assuming the trend continues. it is important to note that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and this analysis does not take into account other factors such as market conditions, company news, or broader economic indicators that could affect stock prices."
