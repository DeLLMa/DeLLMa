    "decision": "action 3. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a significant upward trend over the last year, indicating strong momentum. from december 2022 to november 2023, meta's price increased from 117.96 to 328.49 dollars per share, which is a substantial growth compared to the other two stocks. dis and googl, on the other hand, have shown relatively less growth or even a decrease in price over the same period. dis decreased from 90.83 to 90.37 dollars per share, and googl increased from 92.32 to 133.38 dollars per share, which is a smaller percentage increase compared to meta. given the strong positive trend and the higher price growth, meta is expected to provide a better return on investment by the end of december 2023. therefore, investing 10000 dollars in meta is the recommended action to maximize profit by the end of the month."
