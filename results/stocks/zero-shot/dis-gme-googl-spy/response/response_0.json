    "decision": "action 3. googl: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, googl (alphabet inc.) shows a pattern of increasing prices from the beginning of the year until november. the price increased from 92.32 in december 2022 to 133.38 in november 2023. this suggests a positive trend and a potential for continued growth in december 2023. additionally, the tech sector, where alphabet inc. operates, often sees a surge in activity and investor interest towards the end of the year due to holiday sales and the start of a new fiscal year, which could further drive the stock price up. the other stocks, dis, gme, and spy, do not show as consistent a growth pattern in the same period. dis and gme have been on a downward trend or have shown volatility, and spy, while it has increased recently, does not show as strong a growth pattern as googl. given the budget of 10000 dollars and the goal to maximize profit by the end of december 2023, investing in googl seems to be the most promising option based on the historical data and the general positive trend of the technology sector."
