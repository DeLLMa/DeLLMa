    "decision": "action 2. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a more consistent and significant upward trend over the past year compared to amd. meta's price increased from 117.96 dollars in december 2022 to 328.49 dollars in november 2023, which is a substantial increase. on the other hand, amd's price increased from 68.09 dollars in december 2022 to 117.59 dollars in november 2023, which is also an increase but not as pronounced as meta's. given the strong performance of meta over the past months and the higher current price compared to its historical prices, it suggests a stronger bullish trend for meta. therefore, investing 10000 dollars in meta could potentially yield a higher return by the end of december 2023, assuming the trend continues. it is important to note that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and this recommendation does not take into account other factors such as current market conditions, recent news, financial performance, or future outlooks that could affect stock prices."
