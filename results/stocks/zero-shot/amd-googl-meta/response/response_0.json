    "decision": "action 3. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a significant upward trend over the last year, indicating strong momentum. from november 2022 to november 2023, meta's price increased from 106.40 to 328.49 dollars per share, which is a substantial growth compared to the other two stocks. amd and googl have also increased in price over the same period, but their growth is less pronounced. amd went from 69.61 to 117.59 dollars per share, and googl went from 93.91 to 133.38 dollars per share. given the strong performance and upward trend of meta, it is reasonable to expect that this momentum might continue into december 2023. therefore, investing the 10000 dollars in meta could potentially yield a higher return by the end of the month, assuming the trend persists. it is important to note that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and this recommendation is based solely on historical price data without considering other external factors that could impact stock prices, such as market conditions, economic indicators, company performance, and news events."
