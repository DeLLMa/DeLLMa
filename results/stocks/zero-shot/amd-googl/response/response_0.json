    "decision": "action 1. amd: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, amd has shown a significant increase in price from november to december in the previous year (2022), going from 69.61 dollars to 68.09 dollars. although this is a slight decrease, it indicates a potential for a seasonal increase towards the end of the year. additionally, amd's current price of 119.88 dollars is lower than its peak in june 2023, suggesting there might be room for growth. on the other hand, googl's price has been relatively stable from november to december in the previous year, moving from 93.91 dollars to 92.32 dollars, and its current price of 131.86 dollars is close to its recent historical highs. given the budget of 10000 dollars and the goal to maximize profit by the end of december 2023, investing in amd could potentially offer a higher return based on its recent growth trend and potential for a seasonal increase. however, it's important to note that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and this analysis does not take into account other factors such as market conditions, current company performance, and economic indicators that could affect stock prices."
