    "decision": "action 1. amd: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, amd has shown a significant increase in price from november to december in the previous year (2022), going from 69.61 dollars to 68.09 dollars. although this is a slight decrease, it is important to note that the price in november 2023 is 117.59 dollars, which is substantially higher than the november 2022 price. given this strong position in november, it suggests that amd may have a positive momentum going into december 2023. additionally, amd's current price of 119.88 dollars is close to its recent high in june 2023 of 117.79 dollars, indicating that the stock is currently trading near its higher range for the year. this could suggest a potential for the stock to reach or exceed its previous highs within the month, especially if the company has had positive developments or if the market conditions are favorable. the other stocks, dis and googl, do not show as strong a pattern of increase in the same period, and their current prices are not as close to their yearly highs as amd's. therefore, based on the historical data and the current price relative to the yearly performance, amd appears to be the stock with the highest potential for profit if the pattern holds and there are no unforeseen negative market conditions or company-specific news that could adversely affect the stock price."
