    "decision": "action 2. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta (meta platforms, inc.) has shown a significant upward trend in the last year, moving from a price of 117.96 dollars in december 2022 to 328.49 dollars in november 2023. this represents an increase of approximately 178% over the year. in contrast, dis (the walt disney company) has shown a decrease in price from 90.83 dollars in december 2022 to 90.37 dollars in november 2023, and nvda (nvidia) has shown an increase from 162.12 dollars in december 2022 to 475.31 dollars in november 2023, which is an increase of approximately 193%. however, nvda's current price is 465.25 dollars, indicating a recent drop from its november 2023 high. given the budget of 10000 dollars and the goal to maximize profit by the end of december 2023, meta's consistent upward trend and recent price close to its historical high suggest it may have the momentum to continue increasing in value. additionally, meta's price increase over the past year has been more stable compared to nvda's more volatile price changes. therefore, the recommendation is to invest in meta with the expectation that its stock price will continue to rise by the end of december 2023, potentially providing a higher return on investment."
