    "decision": "action 3. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a consistent upward trend in the last several months, indicating a strong recovery from its lower prices earlier in the year. from january 2023 to november 2023, meta's price has increased from 137.25 dollars to 328.49 dollars per share, suggesting a positive momentum that could continue into december. in contrast, dis has been relatively flat with a slight uptick from 82.62 dollars in october 2023 to 90.37 dollars in november 2023, but it is still below its price from the same period last year. gme has been declining over the past year and is currently at one of its lowest points, which makes it a riskier investment based on recent performance. given the budget of 10000 dollars and the goal to maximize profit by the end of december 2023, investing in meta appears to be the most promising option due to its recent growth trajectory and potential for continued appreciation in stock value."
