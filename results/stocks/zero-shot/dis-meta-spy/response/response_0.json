    "decision": "action 2. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a significant upward trend in the past year, moving from a low of 106.40 in november 2022 to 328.49 in november 2023. this represents a substantial increase and suggests strong positive momentum. in contrast, dis has shown a downward trend over the same period, with a decrease from 96.48 in november 2022 to 90.37 in november 2023. spy, which tracks the s&p 500, has shown some recovery from 391.12 in november 2022 to 445.25 in november 2023, but this increase is not as pronounced as meta's. given the strong performance and upward trend of meta, it is reasonable to expect that this momentum may continue into december 2023, potentially offering a higher return by the end of the month when compared to dis and spy. therefore, the recommendation is to invest the $10,000 in meta with the expectation of capitalizing on its current growth trajectory."
