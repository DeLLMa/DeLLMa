    "decision": "action 3. nvda: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, nvda (nvidia) has shown a significant upward trend over the last 24 months, with the price increasing from $299.31 in december 2021 to $465.25 in december 2023. this represents a growth of approximately 55.5% over the two-year period. in contrast, gme (gamestop corp) has decreased from $39.48 to $14.52, and googl (alphabet, i.e. google) has decreased from $145.15 to $131.86 in the same period. although past performance is not indicative of future results, the strong momentum of nvda suggests it may continue to perform well in the short term. additionally, nvda's price has increased from $436.35 in october 2023 to $475.31 in november 2023 before settling at $465.25 in december 2023, indicating recent positive performance which could continue through the end of the month. given the budget of $10,000, the trader would be able to purchase fewer shares of nvda due to its higher price, but the potential for a higher percentage gain based on recent trends could result in a larger profit when selling at the end of the month. therefore, the recommendation is to invest in nvda."
