    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, nvda has shown a significant upward trend over the last year, with the price increasing from 162.12 in december 2022 to 475.31 in november 2023. this represents an increase of over 193% in 11 months. the current price of nvda is 465.25, which is slightly lower than the november 2023 price, indicating a potential buying opportunity. given the strong momentum and the recent pullback, nvda appears to have the highest potential for a short-term price increase by the end of december 2023. the other stocks have shown either less consistent growth or a downward trend in the same period. additionally, nvda operates in the semiconductor industry, which has been experiencing growth due to increased demand for technology and electronics. this sector trend could further support nvda's stock price increase. therefore, investing 10000 dollars in nvda seems to be the most promising option for maximizing profit by the end of december 2023."
