    "decision": "action 3. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a consistent upward trend over the last year, indicating a strong recovery and growth potential. from december 2022 to november 2023, meta's price increased from 117.96 to 328.49 dollars per share, which is a significant rise. this suggests that the company has been performing well and the market is responding positively to its developments. in contrast, amd's price has been more volatile with a less pronounced upward trend, and gme's price has been declining over the same period. given the budget of 10000 dollars and the goal to maximize profit by the end of december 2023, investing in meta appears to be the most promising option due to its recent strong performance and growth trajectory. it is important to note that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and other factors such as market conditions, company news, and economic indicators should also be considered before making an investment decision. however, with the information provided, meta seems to be the best choice among the three."
