    "decision": "action 2. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta stock has shown a significant upward trend over the last year, moving from a price of 117.96 dollars in december 2022 to 328.49 dollars in november 2023. this represents an increase of approximately 178% over the 12-month period. in contrast, googl stock has shown a more modest increase from 92.32 dollars in december 2022 to 133.38 dollars in november 2023, an increase of about 44% over the same period. given the stronger growth trajectory of meta, it suggests a higher potential for continued growth within the month of december 2023. additionally, with a budget of 10000 dollars, you would be able to purchase more shares of googl due to its lower price, but the higher percentage increase in meta's stock price suggests that it may offer a better return on investment within the given timeframe. therefore, the recommendation is to invest in meta with the expectation that its stock price will continue to outperform googl's in the short term, potentially leading to higher profits when selling at the end of the month."
