    "decision": "action 4. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a significant upward trend in the past year, moving from a low of 106.40 in november 2022 to 328.49 in november 2023. this represents a substantial increase in value, suggesting strong momentum that could continue into december 2023. the other stocks have also shown increases but not as pronounced as meta. amd, dis, and googl have shown some recovery from their lows, but their current prices are closer to their historical prices over the past 24 months, indicating less dramatic growth potential. spy, which tracks the s&p 500, has shown steady growth but also does not match the rapid appreciation seen in meta's stock price. given the strong performance of meta and the potential for continued growth based on its recent trend, investing the full budget of $10,000 in meta is expected to maximize profit by the end of december 2023. it is important to note that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and this recommendation is based solely on historical price data without considering other external factors that could impact stock performance."
