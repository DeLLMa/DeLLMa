    "decision": "action 3. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a consistent upward trend over the last year, indicating a strong recovery from its low in 2022-11. the price has increased from 106.40 dollars in 2022-11 to 328.49 dollars in 2023-11. this represents a significant increase and suggests a positive momentum that could continue into december 2023. in contrast, amd has also shown recovery but has been more volatile with a less steep upward trend. gme's price has decreased over the past year, and spy, while relatively stable, has shown less growth compared to meta. given the strong performance and upward trend of meta, it is expected to potentially offer a higher return by the end of december 2023. therefore, investing 10000 dollars in meta is recommended to maximize profit based on the historical price performance and the recent growth trend observed."
