    "decision": "action 2. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta (meta platforms, inc.) has shown a consistent upward trend in the last several months, moving from a low of 106.40 in november 2022 to 328.49 in november 2023. this represents a significant increase in value over the course of a year. in contrast, gme (gamestop corp) has shown a more volatile and generally downward trend, with the price decreasing from 26.21 in november 2022 to 13.15 in november 2023. given the current momentum and historical performance, meta appears to be on a stronger upward trajectory, which could potentially lead to a higher return by the end of december 2023. it is important to note that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and other factors such as market conditions, company news, and broader economic indicators should also be considered. however, with the information provided and the recent growth trend, meta seems to be the more promising investment for maximizing profit within the specified timeframe."
