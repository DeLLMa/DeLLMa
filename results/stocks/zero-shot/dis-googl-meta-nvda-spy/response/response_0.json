    "decision": "action 3. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a consistent upward trend over the last year, moving from a price of 117.96 dollars in 2022-12 to 328.49 dollars in 2023-11. this represents a significant increase in value, suggesting strong momentum that could continue into the end of 2023-12. the other stocks have either shown less growth or more volatility in the same period. for instance, dis has been relatively flat with a slight uptick in the last month, googl has shown some recovery but not as pronounced as meta, nvda has shown a recent decrease from its peak in 2023-11, and spy, while generally tracking the market, does not show as strong growth potential as meta based on the historical data. given the budget of 10000 dollars and the goal to maximize profit by the end of the month, investing in meta appears to be the most promising option based on its recent strong performance and growth trajectory."
