    "decision": "action 3. nvda: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, nvda has shown a significant upward trend over the last 24 months, with the price increasing from $299.31 in december 2021 to $465.25 in december 2023. this represents a growth of approximately 55.5% over the two-year period. in contrast, amd, dis, and spy have shown less growth or even a decrease in price over the same period. amd's price increased from $143.49 to $119.88, dis decreased from $150.90 to $92.74, and spy increased from $466.41 to $455.77. nvda's growth trajectory suggests a strong momentum that could continue into the end of december 2023. additionally, nvda's price has recently decreased from a november 2023 high of $475.31 to the current price of $465.25, which may indicate a buying opportunity if the stock's growth trend continues. given the budget of $10,000, the trader would be able to purchase fewer shares of nvda compared to the other options, but the potential for a higher percentage return based on historical performance suggests that nvda may offer the best opportunity for maximizing profit by the end of december 2023."
