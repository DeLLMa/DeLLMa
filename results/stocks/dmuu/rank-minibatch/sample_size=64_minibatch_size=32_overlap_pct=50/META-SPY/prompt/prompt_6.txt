I'm a trader planning my next move. I would like to maximize my profit with '10000' dollars.

Below are the actions I can take:
Action 1. META: 10000 dollars
Action 2. SPY: 10000 dollars

I would like to adopt a decision making under uncertainty framework to make my decision. The goal of you, the decision maker, is to choose an optimal action, while accounting for uncertainty in the unknown state. Previously, you have already provided a forecast of future state variables relevant to planting decisions. The state is a vector of 40 elements, each of which is a random variable. The state variables (and their most probable values) are enumerated below:
- economic health: {'growth': 'somewhat likely', 'stable': 'likely', 'recession': 'somewhat unlikely'}
- market sentiment and investor psychology: {'optimistic': 'somewhat likely', 'neutral': 'likely', 'pessimistic': 'somewhat unlikely'}
- political events and government policies: {'stable': 'likely', 'minor changes': 'somewhat likely', 'major upheaval': 'unlikely'}
- natural disasters and other 'black swan' events: {'none': 'likely', 'minor impact': 'somewhat likely', 'major impact': 'unlikely'}
- geopolitical issues: {'stable': 'somewhat likely', 'tensions rising': 'likely', 'escalation to conflict': 'unlikely'}
- company growth of meta platforms, i.e. facebook (meta): {'rapid': 'somewhat likely', 'moderate': 'likely', 'stagnant': 'somewhat unlikely'}
- company product launches of meta platforms, i.e. facebook (meta): {'successful': 'somewhat likely', 'moderate impact': 'likely', 'unsuccessful': 'somewhat unlikely'}
- financial health of meta platforms, i.e. facebook (meta): {'strong': 'somewhat likely', 'stable': 'likely', 'weak': 'somewhat unlikely'}
- merges and major acquisitions related to meta platforms, i.e. facebook (meta): {'none': 'very likely', 'minor': 'somewhat unlikely', 'major': 'unlikely'}
- regulatory changes and legal issues happened to meta platforms, i.e. facebook (meta): {'none': 'likely', 'minor': 'somewhat likely', 'major': 'unlikely'}
- company growth of s&p 500 (spy): {'rapid': 'somewhat likely', 'moderate': 'likely', 'stagnant': 'somewhat unlikely'}
- company product launches of s&p 500 (spy): {'successful': 'somewhat likely', 'moderate impact': 'likely', 'unsuccessful': 'somewhat unlikely'}
- financial health of s&p 500 (spy): {'strong': 'somewhat likely', 'stable': 'likely', 'weak': 'somewhat unlikely'}
- merges and major acquisitions related to s&p 500 (spy): {'none': 'very likely', 'minor': 'somewhat unlikely', 'major': 'unlikely'}
- regulatory changes and legal issues happened to s&p 500 (spy): {'none': 'likely', 'minor': 'somewhat likely', 'major': 'unlikely'}
