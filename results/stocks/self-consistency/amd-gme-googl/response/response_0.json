            "decision": "action 1. amd: 10000 dollars",
            "explanation": "upon reviewing the historical prices of the stocks amd, gme, and googl, it appears that amd has shown a significant upward trend in the last two months, rising from 102.56 in october 2023 to 117.59 in november 2023. this recent momentum might continue through december, potentially leading to a higher end-of-month price and a better profit when selling the stock. in contrast, gme has been relatively volatile with a general downtrend, and its current price is near the lowest in the 24-month period, suggesting higher risk and less predictable returns. googl's price has also increased over the last two months but at a slower pace compared to amd, and its current price is closer to the middle of its 24-month range. given that amd's price has increased the most recently and is closer to the higher end of its historical price range, it indicates stronger recent performance and potential for continued growth. therefore, based on the available historical data and recent price performance, investing the entire budget into amd seems to be the most promising option for maximizing profit by the end of december 2023."
