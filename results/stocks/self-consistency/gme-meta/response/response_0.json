            "explanation": "based on the historical prices provided for both gme and meta, meta shows a more consistent upward trend in the latter months of 2023, starting from july, going from 303.14 to 328.49 in november. gme, on the other hand, has been fluctuating and mostly decreasing over the same period, going from 23.04 in july to 13.15 in november. given that the price of meta has increased significantly in the last few months and is currently slightly below its november high, it suggests a potentially stronger momentum that could continue through december. in contrast, gme's price has been declining and is currently above its november low, which could indicate a potential for further decline or less robust growth. therefore, with the goal of maximizing profit by the end of december 2023, investing in meta appears to be the more promising option given its recent price performance and growth trajectory. it is important to note, however, that past performance is not always indicative of future results, and this recommendation does not account for other factors that could influence stock prices, such as market news, economic reports, or changes in company fundamentals."

            "explanation": "to decide which stock to buy, we should analyze the historical performance and consider potential growth or decline. comparing the historical data for gme and meta, we can see that gme's price has been on a general downward trend over the last 24 months, falling from a high of $39.48 in dec 2021 to just $14.52 currently. on the other hand, meta has shown a positive trend recently, increasing from $106.40 in nov 2022 to $325.48 today. historically, meta seems to have experienced an upward trend in the month of december, as seen from the data provided. given that meta's price has shown an ability to recover and grow, and considering the recent uptrend, it may be more likely to provide a higher return on investment by the end of december 2023. therefore, the recommendation is to invest $10,000 in meta. please note that this recommendation is based solely on historical prices and does not take into account other critical factors such as market conditions, current company performance, news, or economic events that could impact stock prices."
