            "explanation": "based on the historical data provided, amd's stock price shows a pattern of increase from november to december in the year 2022. the price increased from $69.61 in november 2022 to $68.09 in december 2022. although this change was a slight decrease, it was followed by an increase in january 2023. in contrast, dis's stock price decreased from $96.48 in november 2022 to $90.83 in december 2022, and while it did increase in january 2023, the overall pattern is less consistent. considering the most recent monthly change from november 2023 to december 2023, amd's stock increased from $102.56 to $117.59, showing a significant rise. meanwhile, dis only increased from $82.62 to $90.37, which is a smaller increment. with amd's current price of $119.88 and a history of strong end-of-year performance, it may be more likely to offer a higher return by the end of december 2023. therefore, based on the provided historical data and the recent momentum, investing $10,000 in amd appears to have a higher potential for maximizing profit when selling at the end of the month."
