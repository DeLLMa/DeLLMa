Together, these keys should enumerate the top 3 most likely values of the factor variable. Each key should map to your belief verbalized in natural language. If the factor variable is continuous (e.g. changes to a quantity), you should discretize it into 3 bins.\n\nYou should strictly choose your belief from the following list: 'very likely', 'likely', 'somewhat likely', 'somewhat unlikely', 'unlikely', 'very unlikely'.\nFor example, if one of the factor variable is 'climate condition', and the top 3 most likely values are 'drought', 'heavy precipitation', and 'snowstorm', then your response should be formatted as follows:\n{\n    \"climate condition\": {\n        \"drought\": \"somewhat likely\",\n        \"heavy precipitation\": \"very likely\",\n        \"snowstorm\": \"unlikely\"\n    },\n    ...\n}",

The JSON object should contain the following keys:\n- decision: a string that describes the action you recommend the trader to take. The output format should be the same as the format of the actions listed above, e.g. Action 1. AMD: 10000 dollars\n- explanation: a string that describes, in detail, the reasoning behind your decision. You should include information on the expected price of each stock, as well as factors that affect them.",
        "response": {
            "decision": "action 4. meta: 10000 dollars",
            "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta platforms (meta) has shown a significant upward trend in the past year, moving from a price of $117.96 in december 2022 to $328.49 in november 2023. this indicates a strong recovery and growth trend. given the likelihood of positive company performance, continued growth in the tech sector, and positive investor sentiment, it is reasonable to expect that meta's stock could continue this upward momentum in the short term. additionally, the possibility of significant tech advancements boosting company performance is somewhat likely, which could further support meta's stock price. while there are risks associated with market conditions and potential global events, the overall trend for meta appears positive. with a budget of $10000, investing in meta could potentially offer a higher return by the end of december 2023, especially if the stock continues its recent growth trajectory."
