Together, these keys should enumerate the top 3 most likely values of the factor variable. Each key should map to your belief verbalized in natural language. If the factor variable is continuous (e.g. changes to a quantity), you should discretize it into 3 bins.\n\nYou should strictly choose your belief from the following list: 'very likely', 'likely', 'somewhat likely', 'somewhat unlikely', 'unlikely', 'very unlikely'.\nFor example, if one of the factor variable is 'climate condition', and the top 3 most likely values are 'drought', 'heavy precipitation', and 'snowstorm', then your response should be formatted as follows:\n{\n    \"climate condition\": {\n        \"drought\": \"somewhat likely\",\n        \"heavy precipitation\": \"very likely\",\n        \"snowstorm\": \"unlikely\"\n    },\n    ...\n}",

The JSON object should contain the following keys:\n- decision: a string that describes the action you recommend the trader to take. The output format should be the same as the format of the actions listed above, e.g. Action 1. DIS: 10000 dollars\n- explanation: a string that describes, in detail, the reasoning behind your decision. You should include information on the expected price of each stock, as well as factors that affect them.",
        "response": {
            "decision": "action 3. nvda: 10000 dollars",
            "explanation": "based on the historical price data, nvda has shown a significant upward trend over the last 24 months, suggesting strong momentum. despite the current high price, nvda's historical performance indicates that it may continue to grow, potentially offering a higher return by the end of the month. considering the estimated likelihood of various factors, such as technological advancements (likely) and industry trends (continued growth in relevant sectors is somewhat likely), nvda, being a tech company, stands to benefit. the market conditions are volatile, but nvda has demonstrated resilience and growth even in a volatile market. furthermore, the somewhat likely increase in interest rates typically benefits technology stocks as they are growth-oriented. while all stocks are subject to global events and currency fluctuations, nvda's historical trend and position in a growth industry make it a compelling choice for a potential short-term investment with the aim of maximizing profits by the end of the month."
