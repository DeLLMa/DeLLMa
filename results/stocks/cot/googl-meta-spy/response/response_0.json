    "decision": "action 2. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price information provided, meta (meta platforms, inc.) has shown significant growth over the past year, having increased from $106.40 in november 2022 to $328.49 in november 2023. this represents a growth trend that could potentially continue in the short term, especially given the historically bullish behavior of stocks in december due to 'end-of-year trading' activities like portfolio rebalancing and tax-loss harvesting, which are very likely to occur. the company-specific news factors such as earnings reports, product launches, and executive leadership changes are also very likely, likely, and somewhat likely respectively, which can be catalysts for further stock price increases if the news is positive. additionally, the industry trends like changes in advertising revenue could positively impact meta, given its significant revenue from advertising. the global events and market conditions are mixed, but given the recent upward trend and the potential for positive company-specific news, meta seems to be a strong candidate for short-term investment. googl has shown relatively less growth compared to meta, and spy, while diversified, does not show the same level of recent growth as meta. therefore, considering the growth potential and recent momentum, meta is recommended for the investment."
