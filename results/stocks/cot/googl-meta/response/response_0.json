    "decision": "action 2. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, meta has shown a significant upward trend in the past year, moving from a price of 117.96 dollars in december 2022 to 328.49 dollars in november 2023. this suggests a strong positive momentum which could continue into the end of december 2023. on the other hand, googl has shown a more modest increase from 92.32 dollars in december 2022 to 133.38 dollars in november 2023. while both stocks have appreciated in value over the last year, meta's percentage increase is much higher than googl's, indicating a potentially higher rate of return if the trend continues. considering the unknown factors, we have no specific information that would suggest a reversal of the current trends for either company. thus, based on historical performance and the likelihood of the unknown factors, it would be reasonable to expect meta to potentially provide a higher return by the end of december 2023. therefore, investing 10000 dollars in meta could maximize profit, assuming the current trends persist and the unknown factors do not significantly alter the trajectory of the stock prices."
