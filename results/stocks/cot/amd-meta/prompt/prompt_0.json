Together, these keys should enumerate the top 3 most likely values of the factor variable. Each key should map to your belief verbalized in natural language. If the factor variable is continuous (e.g. changes to a quantity), you should discretize it into 3 bins.\n\nYou should strictly choose your belief from the following list: 'very likely', 'likely', 'somewhat likely', 'somewhat unlikely', 'unlikely', 'very unlikely'.\nFor example, if one of the factor variable is 'climate condition', and the top 3 most likely values are 'drought', 'heavy precipitation', and 'snowstorm', then your response should be formatted as follows:\n{\n    \"climate condition\": {\n        \"drought\": \"somewhat likely\",\n        \"heavy precipitation\": \"very likely\",\n        \"snowstorm\": \"unlikely\"\n    },\n    ...\n}",
