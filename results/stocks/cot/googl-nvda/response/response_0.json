    "decision": "action 2. nvda: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical prices provided, nvda (nvidia) has shown a substantial upward trend in the last 24 months, with the price increasing from $299.31 in december 2021 to $465.25 in december 2023. this represents a growth of over 55%, which is a significant appreciation in value. googl (alphabet), on the other hand, has seen a decrease in price from $145.15 in december 2021 to $131.86 in december 2023, indicating a downward trend in the same period. considering the budget of $10,000 and the goal to maximize profit by the end of december 2023, investing in nvda seems more promising based on historical performance. additionally, the empirical estimates of unknown factors suggest that there is likely growth in the tech sector and innovation, which could benefit nvda as it operates in the semiconductor market, which is known for rapid growth and innovation. the positive industry trends, combined with the historical price momentum and somewhat likely high trading volumes, suggest that nvda may continue to perform well in the short term. although rising interest rates are likely, which can generally have a negative impact on stock prices, nvda's strong historical performance may outweigh this risk. furthermore, end-of-year trading dynamics such as tax-loss harvesting and window dressing by fund managers could lead to increased demand for nvda shares if the stock is perceived as a winner. it is important to note that this recommendation is based on historical data and empirical estimates of unknown factors, and actual future stock performance may be influenced by events and developments that are not predictable. therefore, traders should monitor the market closely and be prepared to adjust their positions as new information becomes available."
