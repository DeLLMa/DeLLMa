    "decision": "action 2. nvda: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data and the estimated probabilities of unknown factors, it appears that nvda has demonstrated a strong upward trend over the past 24 months, with the price increasing significantly from $219.61 in april 2022 to $465.25 in december 2023. in contrast, gme has shown a downward trend, decreasing from $36.32 in april 2022 to $14.52 in december 2023. the positive sentiment towards company performance and industry trends for nvda, coupled with the likelihood of continued technological advancements and incremental improvements in nvda's key markets like gaming and ai, suggest that nvda may have a better performance outlook for the end of december 2023. additionally, the holiday season is not expected to have a significant impact on gme, and the potential for analyst upgrades is only somewhat likely, which does not strongly support a substantial increase in gme's stock price. given the stable or increased trading volume and investor sentiment leaning towards positive, nvda seems to be the more promising investment to maximize profit by the end of december 2023. therefore, investing $10,000 in nvda is recommended."
