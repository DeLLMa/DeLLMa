I would like to maximize my profit with '10000' dollars.\n\nBelow are the actions I can take:\nAction 1. AMD: 10000 dollars\nAction 2. DIS: 10000 dollars\nAction 3. GME: 10000 dollars\nAction 4. GOOGL: 10000 dollars\nAction 5. META: 10000 dollars\nAction 6. NVDA: 10000 dollars\nAction 7. SPY: 10000 dollars\n\nNow I have enumerated the unknown factors that would affect my final decisions:\n\n unknown factors:\n  company performance: upcoming earnings reports, product launches, and other company-specific\n    news can affect the stock prices of amd, dis, gme, googl, meta, nvda, and spy.\n  competition: new developments from competitors can impact the perceived value and\n    market share of the companies listed.\n  currency fluctuations: as these companies operate globally, changes in currency\n    exchange rates can affect their reported earnings and stock prices.\n  global events: events such as natural disasters, pandemics, or international conflicts\n    can have unpredictable effects on the stock market.\n  industry trends: trends within the tech industry, entertainment sector, and broader\n    economic trends can influence the performance of these stocks.\n  interest rate changes: changes in interest rates by the federal reserve can influence\n    investor behavior and affect the stock market.\n  investor sentiment: the overall mood and sentiment of investors can cause stock\n    prices to fluctuate, sometimes independently of fundamental factors.\n  market conditions: the overall market conditions, including economic indicators,\n    interest rates, and geopolitical events, can significantly impact stock prices.\n  regulatory changes: any changes in regulations that affect the tech industry, entertainment,\n    or financial markets could impact stock prices.\n  seasonal factors: certain times of the year can have different impacts on companies\n    depending on their business models.\n  technological advances: breakthroughs in technology can either benefit these tech\n    companies or render their products less competitive.\n \n\nGiven these unknow factors, think about the possiblity that each factor would occur within a month. \nYou should format your response as a JSON object, where in each key should be a factor variable listed above. \n\nEach key should map to a JSON object with 3 keys, each of which is a string that describes the value of the factor variable. Together, these keys should enumerate the top 3 most likely values of the factor variable. Each key should map to your belief verbalized in natural language. If the factor variable is continuous (e.g. changes to a quantity), you should discretize it into 3 bins.\n\nYou should strictly choose your belief from the following list: 'very likely', 'likely', 'somewhat likely', 'somewhat unlikely', 'unlikely', 'very unlikely'.\nFor example, if one of the factor variable is 'climate condition', and the top 3 most likely values are 'drought', 'heavy precipitation', and 'snowstorm', then your response should be formatted as follows:\n{\n    \"climate condition\": {\n        \"drought\": \"somewhat likely\",\n        \"heavy precipitation\": \"very likely\",\n        \"snowstorm\": \"unlikely\"\n    },\n    ...\n}",
