    "decision": "action 3. meta: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided and the estimated possibility of occurrence for the unknown factors, it appears that meta (meta platforms, inc.) has shown a strong upward trend in the past year, with the price increasing significantly from $106.40 in 2022-11 to $328.49 in 2023-11. this suggests a robust recovery and positive momentum that could continue into december 2023. the empirical estimates indicate that company performance is likely to be as expected or better than expected, which bodes well for meta given its recent performance. furthermore, industry trends suggest growth is somewhat likely, and investor sentiment is positively inclined. given that meta has already demonstrated substantial growth, it may continue to benefit from these factors. meta also seems less affected by aggressive competition and regulatory changes, based on the likelihood of these factors. while global events and market conditions are volatile and could impact stock prices, the strong recent performance of meta makes it a promising choice for investment with the aim of maximizing profit by the end of december 2023. therefore, investing $10,000 in meta is recommended."
