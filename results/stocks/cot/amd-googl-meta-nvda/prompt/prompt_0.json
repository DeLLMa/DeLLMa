Together, these keys should enumerate the top 3 most likely values of the factor variable. Each key should map to your belief verbalized in natural language. If the factor variable is continuous (e.g. changes to a quantity), you should discretize it into 3 bins.\n\nYou should strictly choose your belief from the following list: 'very likely', 'likely', 'somewhat likely', 'somewhat unlikely', 'unlikely', 'very unlikely'.\nFor example, if one of the factor variable is 'climate condition', and the top 3 most likely values are 'drought', 'heavy precipitation', and 'snowstorm', then your response should be formatted as follows:\n{\n    \"climate condition\": {\n        \"drought\": \"somewhat likely\",\n        \"heavy precipitation\": \"very likely\",\n        \"snowstorm\": \"unlikely\"\n    },\n    ...\n}",

The JSON object should contain the following keys:\n- decision: a string that describes the action you recommend the trader to take. The output format should be the same as the format of the actions listed above, e.g. Action 1. AMD: 10000 dollars\n- explanation: a string that describes, in detail, the reasoning behind your decision. You should include information on the expected price of each stock, as well as factors that affect them.",
        "response": {
            "decision": "action 3. meta: 10000 dollars",
            "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided and the estimated possibility of occurrence for the unknown factors, it appears that meta (meta platforms, inc.) has shown a strong upward trend in the past year, with the price increasing significantly from $106.40 in 2022-11 to $328.49 in 2023-11. this suggests a robust recovery and positive momentum that could continue into december 2023. the empirical estimates indicate that company performance is likely to be as expected or better than expected, which bodes well for meta given its recent performance. furthermore, industry trends suggest growth is somewhat likely, and investor sentiment is positively inclined. given that meta has already demonstrated substantial growth, it may continue to benefit from these factors. meta also seems less affected by aggressive competition and regulatory changes, based on the likelihood of these factors. while global events and market conditions are volatile and could impact stock prices, the strong recent performance of meta makes it a promising choice for investment with the aim of maximizing profit by the end of december 2023. therefore, investing $10,000 in meta is recommended."
