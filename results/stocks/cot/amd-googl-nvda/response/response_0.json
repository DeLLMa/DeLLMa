    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided, nvidia (nvda) has shown a strong upward trend over the last 24 months, with the price increasing from $299.31 in december 2021 to $465.25 in december 2023. this represents a significant appreciation in value. although past performance is not indicative of future results, the momentum and growth exhibited by nvda suggest a robust underlying business and market confidence. given the empirical estimates provided, the likelihood of stable or positive industry trends, market conditions, and company-specific news could favor nvda's continued growth. additionally, nvda's stock price has shown resilience against broader market trends, which could be an indicator of strong fundamentals. with a budget of $10000, investing in nvda could potentially yield a higher return by the end of december 2023, considering the historical growth pattern and the somewhat likely positive factors such as favorable foreign exchange rates, positive industry trends, and stable or bullish market conditions. however, it is important to consider that high stock prices also mean purchasing fewer shares, which could affect the overall profit if the stock does not perform as expected. regardless, nvda's historical performance and growth trajectory place it as a strong candidate for investment with the aim to maximize profit by the end of december 2023."
