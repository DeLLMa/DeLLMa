    "decision": "action 4. nvda: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data provided for each stock, nvidia (nvda) has shown a significant positive trend over the past 24 months, with an overall increase in its stock price from $299.31 in december 2021 to $465.25 in december 2023. the price has been particularly strong in the last six months, suggesting strong momentum. this is reflected in the historical prices, where nvda has consistently increased in value from may 2023 to november 2023, indicating a robust growth trajectory. considering the unknown factors, the semiconductor industry (which nvda is a part of) is likely to perform averagely or strongly, and with the market trending towards a bull market or sideways, this could further support nvda's stock price. additionally, with neutral investor sentiment being likely, and no significant legal or regulatory changes expected, the external factors seem to have a neutral to positive impact on nvda's stock. given the high price of nvda shares, the $10,000 investment will buy fewer shares compared to the other options, but the strong growth trend suggests a higher potential for significant capital appreciation. therefore, despite the fact that the historical performance does not guarantee future results, based on the available data and the estimated impact of the unknown factors, nvda appears to be the most promising investment for maximizing profit by the end of december 2023."
