    "decision": "action 2. nvda: 10000 dollars",
    "explanation": "based on the historical price data, nvda has shown a more consistent and significant upward trend over the last 24 months compared to meta. nvda's price has increased from 299.31 in december 2021 to 465.25 in december 2023, which is a significant growth trajectory. meta, while also increasing in price, has shown a less pronounced growth, moving from 330.85 in december 2021 to 325.48 in december 2023, even dipping below its initial price at certain points. considering the empirical estimates of unknown factors, nvda seems to be in a strong position within the semiconductor industry, which is somewhat likely to experience specific positive trends. the technology sector growth is likely, and steady advancements benefiting the sector are also likely, which could favor nvda as a leading semiconductor company. interest rates are likely to remain stable, which should not negatively impact growth stocks like nvda. although economic conditions may worsen and geopolitical tensions could escalate, nvda's strong historical performance suggests resilience in its stock value. furthermore, the global economy's impact on currency fluctuations is considered likely, which could affect both stocks, but nvda's stronger growth trend may offer better protection against these fluctuations. meta could be more susceptible to regulatory changes and antitrust actions, even though these are considered unlikely, the potential impact could be more detrimental to meta than to nvda. lastly, nvda's position in the market may benefit from technological advances, especially in ai and semiconductor manufacturing. therefore, based on the historical performance and the potential impact of the estimated unknown factors, nvda appears to be the better investment for maximizing profit by the end of december 2023."
