    "decision": "action 1. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest yield and price per unit among the options. the average yield for avocados is 2.87 tons per acre, and the average price is $2,430 per ton. multiplying the yield by the price, we get an expected revenue of $6,971.10 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). for 10 acres, this would be $69,711. despite the challenges such as wildfires and water restrictions, the u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, and the market is heavily supported by imports, indicating a strong demand. grapefruits and pears have lower yields and prices per unit. grapefruits yield 457 boxes per acre at $24.33 per box, which equals $11,118.81 per acre, and for 10 acres, it would be $111,188.10. however, grapefruit production has been halved due to winter storm uri, and the market is uncertain. pears yield 15.6 tons per acre at $565 per ton, which equals $8,814 per acre, and for 10 acres, it would be $88,140. the pear market is also facing uncertainty due to the northwest heat wave. therefore, despite the risks, avocados are expected to provide the highest return per acre, making them the recommended action."
