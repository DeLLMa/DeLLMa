    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at 2,430 $ / ton, with a yield of 2.87 tons / acre. over 10 acres, this would result in an expected revenue of 2,430 $ / ton * 2.87 tons / acre * 10 acre = 69,741 $. in comparison, apples have a lower price per unit at 0.244 $ / lb, with a yield of 19,000 lb / acre, resulting in an expected revenue of 0.244 $ / lb * 19,000 lb / acre * 10 acre = 46,360 $. grapes have a price per unit of 908 $ / ton with a yield of 6.92 tons / acre, leading to an expected revenue of 908 $ / ton * 6.92 tons / acre * 10 acre = 62,857.6 $. pears have the lowest expected revenue with a price per unit of 565 $ / ton and a yield of 15.6 tons / acre, resulting in 565 $ / ton * 15.6 tons / acre * 10 acre = 88,140 $. however, considering the market factors, pear production is forecasted to decline and the impact of the northwest heat wave on production levels is still uncertain, which could potentially affect yields negatively. avocado consumption has increased significantly and despite the decrease in california production due to wildfires and water restrictions, the high price per unit and the growing demand make avocados the most profitable option among the choices. therefore, planting avocados is recommended to maximize profit."
