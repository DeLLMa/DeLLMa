    "decision": "action 3. peach: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, we will calculate the expected revenue per acre for each fruit and then multiply by 10 acres to determine the total expected revenue for each action. the fruit with the highest total expected revenue will be recommended. the expected revenue per acre is calculated by multiplying the average yield per acre by the average price per unit.\n\n- avocado: 2.87 tons/acre * 2,430 $/ton = 6,971.1 $/acre\n- grape: 6.92 tons/acre * 908 $/ton = 6,283.36 $/acre\n- peach: 13.7 tons/acre * 763 $/ton = 10,453.1 $/acre\n- pear: 15.6 tons/acre * 565 $/ton = 8,814 $/acre\n\nwhen we multiply these figures by 10 acres, we get:\n\n- avocado: 6,971.1 $/acre * 10 acres = 69,711 $\n- grape: 6,283.36 $/acre * 10 acres = 62,833.6 $\n- peach: 10,453.1 $/acre * 10 acres = 104,531 $\n- pear: 8,814 $/acre * 10 acres = 88,140 $\n\npeaches have the highest expected revenue per acre and thus the highest total expected revenue when considering planting on 10 acres. despite the weather challenges, peach production is forecasted to be up and potentially the largest crop since 2017. this suggests a strong market and a good opportunity for profit. therefore, the recommended action is to plant peaches on 10 acres of land."
