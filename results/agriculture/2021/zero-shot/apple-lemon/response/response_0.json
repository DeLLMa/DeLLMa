    "decision": "action 2. lemon: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, the decision to plant lemons on 10 acres of land is recommended for maximizing profit. the average yield for apples is reported to be 19,000 pounds per acre with an average price of $0.244 per pound. in contrast, the average yield for lemons is 428 boxes per acre with an average price of $23.3 per box. to compare the potential revenue from each crop, we need to calculate the total revenue per acre and then for 10 acres. for apples, the revenue per acre would be 19,000 lb x $0.244/lb = $4,636. for lemons, assuming a standard box of lemons weighs approximately 40 pounds, the revenue per acre would be 428 boxes x 40 lb/box x $23.3/box = $398,864. therefore, the revenue for 10 acres of apples would be $46,360, while for lemons, it would be $3,988,640. despite the lower production of lemons in recent years, the significantly higher price per unit for lemons compared to apples suggests that lemons would yield a higher return per acre. additionally, the report indicates that apple prices may be lower due to an increase in domestic supply and sluggish export markets, while lemon grower prices have risen by 7 percent despite a decrease in production. these factors suggest that lemons are likely to be more profitable than apples on a per-acre basis for the upcoming year."
