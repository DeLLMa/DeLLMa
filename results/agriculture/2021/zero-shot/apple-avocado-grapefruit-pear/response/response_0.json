    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an expected revenue of $6,971.10 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). over 10 acres, this would equate to $69,711. for apples, the expected revenue is $4,636 per acre (19,000 lb/acre * $0.244/lb), which totals $46,360 over 10 acres. grapefruits have an expected revenue of $11,116.81 per acre (457 boxes/acre * $24.33/box), totaling $111,168.10 over 10 acres, but this is based on 'on tree equivalent' and does not account for harvesting and packing costs. pears have an expected revenue of $8,814 per acre (15.6 tons/acre * $565/ton), totaling $88,140 over 10 acres. while grapefruits seem to offer a higher revenue, the costs associated with harvesting and packing could significantly reduce the net profit. additionally, grapefruit production has been significantly affected by winter storm uri, and the market is uncertain. avocados, despite the lower yield, offer a higher price per unit and have seen an increase in u.s. consumption, with less production uncertainty mentioned in the report. therefore, planting avocados is the recommended action to maximize profit on the 10 acres of land in california."
