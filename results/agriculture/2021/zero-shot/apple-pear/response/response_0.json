    "decision": "action 2. pear: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, the expected yield for apples is 19,000 pounds per acre with an average price of $0.244 per pound. for pears, the expected yield is 15.6 tons per acre with an average price of $565 per ton. to compare the profitability of apples and pears, we need to convert the units to a common measure and calculate the total revenue per acre for each fruit. there are 2,000 pounds in a ton, so the pear yield is 31,200 pounds per acre (15.6 tons x 2,000 pounds/ton). the revenue per acre for apples would be 19,000 pounds x $0.244/pound = $4,636. the revenue per acre for pears would be 31,200 pounds x ($565/ton) / (2,000 pounds/ton) = $8,844. therefore, pears are expected to generate a higher revenue per acre than apples. additionally, while there is concern over heat damage for apples, traditional pear trees may offer some protection from heat damage. considering the higher expected revenue and potentially lower risk of heat damage, planting pears is the recommended action."
