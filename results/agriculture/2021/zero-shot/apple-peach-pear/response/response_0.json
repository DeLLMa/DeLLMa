    "decision": "action 2. peach: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report and the california price and yield statistics, we can calculate the expected revenue for each fruit per acre and then for 10 acres. for apples, the expected revenue per acre is 19,000 lb * 0.244 $/lb = 4,636 $/acre. for peaches, the expected revenue per acre is 13.7 tons * 763 $/ton = 10,453.1 $/acre. for pears, the expected revenue per acre is 15.6 tons * 565 $/ton = 8,814 $/acre. when we calculate these revenues for 10 acres, we get 46,360 $ for apples, 104,531 $ for peaches, and 88,140 $ for pears. therefore, planting peaches is expected to be the most profitable option, yielding the highest revenue per acre. this recommendation takes into account the current market conditions, including the increase in peach production and the higher price per unit for peaches compared to apples and pears. additionally, while there are concerns about weather challenges, the report suggests that california expects an increase in peach production, which may indicate favorable conditions for peach growth in the upcoming year."
