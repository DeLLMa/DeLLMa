    "decision": "action 2. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, grape production is forecasted to be up 9 percent from 2020 despite drought and heat conditions, indicating a resilient crop. the average grape yield in california is 6.92 tons per acre with an average price of $908 per ton. multiplying the yield by the price per unit and then by the total acreage (6.92 tons/acre * $908/ton * 10 acres), the expected revenue from planting grapes on 10 acres would be approximately $628,576. this is the highest potential revenue when compared to the other fruits mentioned. apples, while having an increased production, face potential price drops due to sluggish export markets. lemons have seen a decrease in production and an increase in import competition, which could affect domestic prices negatively. peaches have a good production forecast but lower expected revenue per acre compared to grapes. therefore, planting grapes is recommended for maximizing profit on the 10 acres of land available."
