    "decision": "action 1. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report and the current market conditions, planting avocados seems to be the most profitable option for your 10 acres of land in california. the average yield for avocados is 2.87 tons per acre, and the average price per ton is $2,430. this would result in an expected revenue of $69,681 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton), or $696,810 for 10 acres. in comparison, lemons have an average yield of 428 boxes per acre, with an average price of $23.3 per box, which would result in an expected revenue of $9,974.4 per acre, or $99,744 for 10 acres. peaches have an average yield of 13.7 tons per acre, with an average price of $763 per ton, resulting in an expected revenue of $10,452.1 per acre, or $104,521 for 10 acres. despite the challenges such as wildfires and water restrictions, the high demand and price for avocados, combined with the significant consumption and reliance on imports, make avocados the most lucrative option among the three. additionally, the decrease in california avocado production may lead to even higher prices, potentially increasing profitability further."
