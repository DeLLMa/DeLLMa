    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, the decision to plant avocados seems to be the most profitable for the following reasons: the average yield for avocados in california is 2.87 tons per acre, and the average price per ton is $2,430. when calculated for 10 acres, the expected revenue would be 2.87 tons/acre * 10 acres * $2,430/ton = $69,681. despite the challenges of wildfires and water restrictions, u.s. avocado consumption has increased significantly, and the market is heavily reliant on imports, suggesting a strong domestic demand for avocados. in contrast, apple production is facing heat damage concerns and potential price drops due to an oversupplied domestic market. grape production, while up, is contending with drought and heat conditions that could affect yields unpredictably. grapefruit has been significantly affected by winter storms and disease, leading to reduced domestic production and higher prices, but the yield is lower compared to other fruits. pear production is forecasted to be similar to the previous year, but with uncertainties due to heat waves. therefore, despite the challenges, the high price per unit and the increasing consumption of avocados make avocado farming the most promising option among the choices provided."
