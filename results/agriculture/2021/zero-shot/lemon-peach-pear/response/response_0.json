    "decision": "action 2. peach: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, planting peaches appears to be the most profitable option. the average peach yield is 13.7 tons per acre, and the average price per ton is $763. multiplying the yield by the price per ton and then by 10 acres, the expected revenue from peaches would be 13.7 tons/acre * $763/ton * 10 acres = $104,531. the peach production is also forecasted to be up 13 percent from the previous year, which could potentially be the largest crop since 2017, indicating a strong market and demand for peaches. in contrast, lemon production is at its lowest in five years, and despite the increase in grower prices by 7 percent, the yield of 428 boxes per acre at $23.3 per box would result in a revenue of 428 boxes/acre * $23.3/box * 10 acres = $99,724, which is lower than that of peaches. pear production is forecasted to be similar to the previous year, and with an average yield of 15.6 tons per acre and a price of $565 per ton, the expected revenue would be 15.6 tons/acre * $565/ton * 10 acres = $88,140, which is the least profitable among the three options. therefore, considering the expected yield, price, and market trends, planting peaches is the recommended action."
