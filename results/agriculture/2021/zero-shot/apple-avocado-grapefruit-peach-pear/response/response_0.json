    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at 2,430 $ / ton, with a yield of 2.87 tons / acre. over 10 acres, this would equate to an expected revenue of 2,430 $ / ton * 2.87 tons / acre * 10 acre = 69,741 $. although there are concerns about wildfires and water restrictions, the u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, and the market is less dependent on domestic production due to imports. this suggests that while there may be production challenges, the market for avocados remains strong. in comparison, apples, grapefruits, peaches, and pears have lower prices per unit and yields that do not compensate for the higher price per unit of avocados. additionally, apples and grapefruits are facing significant production uncertainties due to weather events, which could further impact yields negatively. peaches and pears have more favorable production forecasts, but their lower prices per unit make them less profitable than avocados on a per-acre basis. therefore, planting avocados is the recommended action to maximize profit on the 10 acres of land available."
