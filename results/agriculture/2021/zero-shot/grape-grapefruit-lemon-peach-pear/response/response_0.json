    "decision": "action 1. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, grape production offers the highest potential profit per acre. the average grape yield in california is 6.92 tons per acre, with an average price of $908 per ton. this results in an expected revenue of $6,282.56 per acre (6.92 tons/acre * $908/ton). over 10 acres, this would equate to $62,825.60. despite the drought and heat conditions, grape production is forecasted to be up 9 percent from 2020, indicating a resilient and growing market. additionally, while imports from mexico were down slightly, overall shipments were higher in 2021 than the previous year, suggesting a strong demand for grapes. the other fruits, while also profitable, have lower yields or prices per unit. for example, grapefruit and lemon production have been significantly affected by adverse weather conditions and diseases, leading to lower yields and higher prices, but not enough to surpass grapes in terms of revenue per acre. peach production is up, but the price per ton is lower than grapes, and pear production is forecasted to be similar to the previous year with an uncertain impact from the heat wave. therefore, planting grapes is the recommended action to maximize profit on your 10 acres of land."
