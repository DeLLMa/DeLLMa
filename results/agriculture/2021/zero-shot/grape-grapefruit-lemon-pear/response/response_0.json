    "decision": "action 1. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, planting grapes appears to be the most profitable option. the average grape yield in california is 6.92 tons per acre, and the average price per ton is $908. with 10 acres, the expected yield would be 69.2 tons, and the potential revenue would be $62,825.6 (69.2 tons * $908 per ton). despite drought and heat conditions, grape production is forecasted to be up 9 percent from 2020, indicating a resilient and growing market. in contrast, grapefruit and lemon productions have been significantly affected by adverse weather conditions, and pear production is forecasted to decline. additionally, the grape market has seen an increase in shipments and a slight decrease in imports from mexico, suggesting a strong domestic demand. the high grower price indices for fruits and nuts also support the decision to plant grapes, as they are likely to yield a higher return on investment compared to the other fruits listed."
