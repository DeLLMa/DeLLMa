    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have a higher yield and price per unit compared to apples in california. the average avocado yield is 2.87 tons / acre with an average price of 2,430 $ / ton, while the average apple yield is 19,000 lb / acre with an average price of 0.244 $ / lb. to compare the profitability, we need to convert the yields to a common unit and calculate the total revenue per acre for each fruit. there are 2,000 pounds in a ton, so the average avocado yield is 5,740 lb / acre (2.87 tons/acre * 2,000 lb/ton). the revenue per acre for avocados is therefore 5,740 lb / acre * 2,430 $ / ton / 2,000 lb/ton = 6,996.1 $ / acre. for apples, the revenue per acre is 19,000 lb / acre * 0.244 $ / lb = 4,636 $ / acre. therefore, avocados are expected to be more profitable, yielding approximately 6,996.1 $ / acre compared to apples' 4,636 $ / acre. additionally, the report indicates that apple production may face challenges due to heat damage and sluggish export markets, which could further reduce profitability. in contrast, u.s. avocado consumption has increased, and despite lower production due to wildfires and water restrictions, the high demand and substantial imports suggest a robust market for avocados. therefore, planting avocados on the 10 acres of land is the recommended action to maximize profit."
