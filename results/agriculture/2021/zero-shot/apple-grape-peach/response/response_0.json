    "decision": "action 2. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, grape production offers the highest potential revenue per acre. the average grape yield in california is 6.92 tons per acre with an average price of $908 per ton. multiplying the yield by the price gives us an expected revenue of $6,282.56 per acre (6.92 tons/acre * $908/ton). for 10 acres, this would be $62,825.6. in comparison, apples yield 19,000 lbs per acre at $0.244 per lb, which equates to $4,636 per acre or $46,360 for 10 acres. peaches yield 13.7 tons per acre at $763 per ton, resulting in $10,453.1 per acre or $104,531 for 10 acres. despite peaches having a higher revenue per acre than apples, grapes still provide the highest potential revenue among the three options. additionally, the report indicates that grape production is forecasted to be up from the previous year despite drought and heat conditions, suggesting a resilient crop. while the report mentions high heat affecting the industry, it also notes that overall shipments were higher in 2021 than the previous year, indicating a strong market for grapes. therefore, planting grapes on 10 acres of land is the recommended action to maximize profit."
