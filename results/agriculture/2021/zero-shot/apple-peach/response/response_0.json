    "decision": "action 2. peach: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, planting peaches is expected to be more profitable than planting apples. the average yield for apples in california is 19,000 pounds per acre, with an average price of $0.244 per pound. this would result in an expected revenue of $4,636 per acre (19,000 lb x $0.244/lb). for peaches, the average yield is 13.7 tons per acre, with an average price of $763 per ton. since 1 ton is equal to 2,000 pounds, the expected revenue for peaches would be $10,455.1 per acre (13.7 tons x $763/ton). multiplying these revenues by 10 acres, apples would yield approximately $46,360, while peaches would yield approximately $104,551. the report also indicates that peach production is forecasted to be up and potentially the largest crop since 2017, despite weather challenges. on the other hand, while apple production is up from the previous year, there is concern over heat damage and sluggish export markets, which could push more apples into the domestic market and lower prices. additionally, processing prices for apples may rise due to declines in other states, but this does not necessarily translate to higher profits for fresh apple growers in california. therefore, based on the expected yield, price, and market conditions, planting peaches is the recommended action to maximize profit on the 10 acres of land."
