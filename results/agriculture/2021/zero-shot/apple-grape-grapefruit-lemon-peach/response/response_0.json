    "decision": "action 2. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, grape production is forecasted to be up 9 percent from 2020 despite drought and heat conditions, indicating a strong growth trend. the average grape yield in california is 6.92 tons / acre with an average price per unit of 908 $ / ton. multiplying the yield by the price per unit and then by the total acreage (10 acres), we get an expected revenue of 628,736 $ (6.92 * 908 * 10). this is the highest expected revenue among the options provided. while there are concerns about heat affecting the industry, the report indicates that shipments are up, suggesting a resilient market. additionally, the decrease in imports from mexico, the main competitor, could mean less competition for california grapes. the other fruits either have lower yields or prices or are facing more significant production challenges, such as heat damage for apples and lemons, and citrus greening disease for grapefruit. peaches show a promising increase in production, but the expected revenue is lower than that of grapes. therefore, planting grapes on 10 acres of land is the recommended action to maximize profit."
