    "decision": "action 2. lemon: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report and the california price and yield statistics, we can calculate the expected revenue for each fruit per acre and then extrapolate that to 10 acres. for apples, the average yield is 19,000 lb / acre with a price of 0.244 $ / lb, which would result in a revenue of 19,000 * 0.244 = $4,636 per acre, or $46,360 for 10 acres. for lemons, the average yield is 428 boxes / acre with a price of 23.3 $ / box, resulting in a revenue of 428 * 23.3 = $9,972.4 per acre, or $99,724 for 10 acres. for pears, the average yield is 15.6 tons / acre with a price of 565 $ / ton, which would result in a revenue of 15.6 * 565 = $8,814 per acre, or $88,140 for 10 acres. comparing these revenues, lemons provide the highest potential revenue per acre and for 10 acres. additionally, the report indicates that lemon production is at its lowest in five years, which could mean less competition and higher prices, despite the increase in imports. the report also mentions a 7 percent increase in grower prices for lemons, which could further increase revenue. therefore, based on the expected yield, price, and market conditions, planting lemons would be the most profitable action for maximizing profit on 10 acres of land in california."
