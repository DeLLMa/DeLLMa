    "decision": "action 3. peach: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report and the california price and yield statistics, we can calculate the expected revenue for each fruit per acre and then extrapolate that to 10 acres. for apples, the average yield is 19,000 lb per acre and the average price is $0.244 per lb, which would result in a revenue of $4,636 per acre (19,000 lb * $0.244/lb). for grapefruits, the average yield is 457 boxes per acre and the average price is $24.33 per box, resulting in a revenue of $11,122.81 per acre (457 boxes * $24.33/box). for peaches, the average yield is 13.7 tons per acre and the average price is $763 per ton, resulting in a revenue of $10,453.1 per acre (13.7 tons * $763/ton). when we multiply these revenues by 10 acres, we get the following potential total revenues: $46,360 for apples, $111,228.10 for grapefruits, and $104,531 for peaches. grapefruit production has been significantly affected by winter storm uri, and the citrus greening disease has led to lower production levels, which may introduce more risk. apple production is up, but heat damage and sluggish export markets could push more apples into the domestic market, potentially lowering prices. peach production is forecasted to be up 13 percent from the previous year, potentially the largest crop since 2017, and the price is also relatively high. considering the higher revenue potential and the positive outlook for peach production, the recommended action is to plant peaches on 10 acres."
