    "decision": "action 2. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report and the california price and yield statistics, we can calculate the expected revenue for each fruit per acre and then extrapolate that to 10 acres to determine which fruit would potentially yield the highest profit. the calculations are as follows: for apples, the expected revenue per acre is 19,000 lb * 0.244 $/lb = 4,636 $/acre. for grapes, the expected revenue per acre is 6.92 tons * 908 $/ton = 6,283.36 $/acre. for lemons, the expected revenue per acre is 428 boxes * 23.3 $/box = 9,973.4 $/acre. when we multiply these figures by 10 acres, we get 46,360 $ for apples, 62,833.6 $ for grapes, and 99,734 $ for lemons. although lemons have the highest expected revenue per acre, the report indicates that lemon production is at its lowest in five years and has decreased by 6 percent for the fresh market, with significant heat damage in arizona. this suggests a riskier investment due to potential production issues. grapes, on the other hand, have seen an increase in production despite drought and heat conditions, and the market for california table-type grapes is expected to increase. given the higher expected revenue per acre for grapes compared to apples, and the lower production risk compared to lemons, planting grapes appears to be the most balanced option in terms of potential profit and risk. therefore, the recommended action is to plant grapes on 10 acres."
