    "decision": "action 2. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, grape production appears to be the most profitable option for your 10 acres of land in california. the average grape yield is 6.92 tons / acre with an average price per unit of 908 $ / ton. multiplying the yield by the price per unit and then by 10 acres, we get an expected revenue of 628,416 $ for grapes (6.92 * 908 * 10). in comparison, avocados would yield approximately 2.87 tons / acre at 2,430 $ / ton, resulting in an expected revenue of 696,810 $ (2.87 * 2430 * 10). however, the avocado market is heavily dominated by imports from mexico and peru, and california production has decreased due to wildfires and water restrictions, which introduces higher risk and potential for lower yields than forecasted. lemons have a lower yield of 428 boxes / acre at 23.3 $ / box, resulting in an expected revenue of 99,784 $ (428 * 23.3 * 10). peaches have a yield of 13.7 tons / acre at 763 $ / ton, resulting in an expected revenue of 104,471 $ (13.7 * 763 * 10). despite the higher price per ton for avocados, the risk factors such as wildfires, water restrictions, and heavy competition from imports make grapes a more stable and profitable choice. additionally, the grape industry has shown resilience to drought and heat conditions with an increase in production forecasted, suggesting a more reliable crop under current climate conditions."
