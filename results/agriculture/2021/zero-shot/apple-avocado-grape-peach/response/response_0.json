    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an average revenue of $6,974.1 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). over 10 acres, this would equate to $69,741. for apples, the average revenue per acre would be $4,636 (19,000 lbs/acre * $0.244/lb), for grapes it would be $6,282.56 (6.92 tons/acre * $908/ton), and for peaches, it would be $10,454.1 (13.7 tons/acre * $763/ton). despite the high revenue per acre for peaches, avocados still represent the highest potential revenue over 10 acres. additionally, the report indicates that u.s. avocado consumption has increased significantly, and despite lower production in california due to wildfires and water restrictions, the market for avocados remains strong with substantial imports from mexico and peru. this suggests a stable and growing demand for avocados, which could help maintain or even increase the current price levels. therefore, planting avocados is the recommended action to maximize profit on the 10 acres of land."
