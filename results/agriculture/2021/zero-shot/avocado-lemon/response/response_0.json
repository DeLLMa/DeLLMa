    "decision": "action 1. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, the decision to plant avocados on 10 acres of land is recommended for maximizing profit. the average yield for avocados is 2.87 tons per acre, and the average price per ton is $2,430. therefore, planting avocados on 10 acres could potentially yield 28.7 tons and generate approximately $69,681 (28.7 tons * $2,430/ton). in contrast, lemons have an average yield of 428 boxes per acre with an average price of $23.3 per box. planting lemons on 10 acres could yield 4,280 boxes and generate approximately $99,744 (4,280 boxes * $23.3/box). however, it is important to consider that lemon production is at its lowest in five years and has decreased by 6 percent for the fresh market, which could indicate a risk of lower yields or potential market saturation. additionally, the report mentions that avocado consumption has increased significantly, and despite the decrease in california's production, the market is supplemented by imports, suggesting a strong and growing demand for avocados. the higher grower prices for avocados also indicate a potentially more lucrative market. therefore, despite the higher gross revenue from lemons, the increasing demand and price for avocados, combined with the risks associated with lemon production, make avocados the recommended choice."
