    "decision": "action 1. peach: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, planting peaches would be more profitable than planting pears on your 10 acres of land. the average yield for peaches is 13.7 tons per acre with an average price of $763 per ton, while pears yield 15.6 tons per acre with a lower average price of $565 per ton. calculating the total revenue for each crop: for peaches, 13.7 tons/acre * 10 acres * $763/ton equals $104,451, and for pears, 15.6 tons/acre * 10 acres * $565/ton equals $88,140. despite the higher yield of pears, the higher price per ton for peaches results in a greater overall revenue. additionally, peach production is forecasted to be up 13 percent from the previous year, which could potentially be the largest crop since 2017, indicating a strong market for peaches. although there are concerns about the impact of extreme weather events and california's ongoing drought, the expected increase in peach production and the higher price per ton make peaches the more profitable option for your farm."
