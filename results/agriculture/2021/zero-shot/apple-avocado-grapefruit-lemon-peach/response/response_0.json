    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an expected revenue of $6,973.10 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). over 10 acres, this would equate to $69,731.00. in comparison, apples yield 19,000 lbs per acre at $0.244 per lb, which translates to $4,636 per acre and $46,360 over 10 acres. grapefruits yield 457 boxes per acre at $24.33 per box, resulting in $11,118.81 per acre and $111,188.10 over 10 acres. lemons yield 428 boxes per acre at $23.3 per box, totaling $9,974.40 per acre and $99,744 over 10 acres. peaches yield 13.7 tons per acre at $763 per ton, which amounts to $10,453.10 per acre and $104,531 over 10 acres. although grapefruits and lemons have higher total revenues over 10 acres than avocados, the market for avocados is growing significantly, with high u.s. consumption and substantial imports indicating strong demand. additionally, the challenges faced by grapefruit and lemon production, such as disease and heat damage, may introduce more risk. therefore, considering the high price per unit, strong market demand, and the potential for a less risky investment, planting avocados is the recommended action."
