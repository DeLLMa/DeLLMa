    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report and the california price and yield statistics, avocados have the highest average price per unit at 2,430 $ / ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons / acre. when calculating the potential revenue per acre, avocados would yield approximately 6,973.10 $ / acre (2.87 tons / acre * 2,430 $ / ton). in comparison, apples have an average price of 0.244 $ / lb with a yield of 19,000 lb / acre, which would result in a revenue of approximately 4,636 $ / acre (19,000 lb / acre * 0.244 $ / lb). pears have an average price of 565 $ / ton with a yield of 15.6 tons / acre, resulting in a revenue of approximately 8,814 $ / acre (15.6 tons / acre * 565 $ / ton). although pears have a higher revenue per acre than avocados, the report indicates a decline in pear production and uncertainty due to the northwest heat wave, which could affect yields negatively. avocado consumption has increased significantly, and despite the decrease in california production, the market is supplemented by imports, indicating strong demand. therefore, considering the high price per unit, strong market demand, and the potential revenue per acre, planting avocados on 10 acres of land is the recommended action to maximize profit, despite the challenges of wildfires and water restrictions."
