    "decision": "action 1. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report data, the decision to plant avocados would likely maximize profit on your 10 acres of land in california. although california avocado production has decreased due to wildfires and water restrictions, the u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, with a strong import market. the average yield for avocados is 2.87 tons per acre, and the average price is $2,430 per ton. this suggests a high potential revenue per acre, which is $6,973.10 (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). in comparison, lemons have a lower yield of 428 boxes per acre and a price of $23.3 per box, resulting in a revenue of $9,974.40 per acre (428 boxes/acre * $23.3/box). peaches have a yield of 13.7 tons per acre with a price of $763 per ton, totaling $10,452.10 per acre (13.7 tons/acre * $763/ton). pears have a yield of 15.6 tons per acre at $565 per ton, which equals $8,814 per acre (15.6 tons/acre * $565/ton). despite the higher revenue per acre for lemons and peaches, the market for avocados is strong with increasing consumption and high prices, which could offset the lower yield per acre when compared to lemons and peaches. additionally, the avocado market is less likely to be saturated due to the decrease in california's production, potentially leading to better prices for your crop. therefore, considering the market demand, price per unit, and the current challenges in the avocado supply, planting avocados appears to be the most profitable action."
