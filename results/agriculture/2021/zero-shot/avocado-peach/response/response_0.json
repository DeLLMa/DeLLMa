    "decision": "action 1. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, the expected yield for avocados is 2.87 tons per acre with an average price of $2,430 per ton. for peaches, the expected yield is 13.7 tons per acre with an average price of $763 per ton. to calculate the expected revenue for each crop, we multiply the yield per acre by the price per ton and then by the total acreage. for avocados, the expected revenue would be 2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton * 10 acres = $69,681. for peaches, the expected revenue would be 13.7 tons/acre * $763/ton * 10 acres = $104,531. although the revenue for peaches seems higher, we must consider the market factors and challenges. the report indicates that avocado consumption has increased significantly and that u.s. production has decreased, which could lead to higher prices due to demand outpacing local supply. additionally, the report mentions that peach production is forecasted to be up, which could potentially lead to a decrease in prices due to a larger supply. considering these factors, along with the high grower price index for fruits and nuts, and the ongoing drought and water restrictions in california which may affect peach yields more severely, it is recommended to plant avocados as they have a higher price per ton and a growing market demand, which could result in a more profitable outcome despite the lower yield per acre."
