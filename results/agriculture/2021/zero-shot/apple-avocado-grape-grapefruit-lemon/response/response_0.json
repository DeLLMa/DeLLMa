    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, the decision to plant avocados seems to be the most profitable for the following reasons: the average yield for avocados is 2.87 tons per acre, and the average price per unit is $2,430 per ton. when calculated for 10 acres, the expected revenue would be 2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton * 10 acres = $69,681. despite the decrease in california avocado production due to wildfires and water restrictions, u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, and the market is heavily reliant on imports. this suggests a strong domestic demand and potential for higher prices. in contrast, apple production is up, but export markets are sluggish, which could push more apples into the domestic market and lower prices. grapes have seen an increase in production, but high heat has affected the industry, and the price per ton is significantly lower than avocados. grapefruit and lemon production have both decreased, and while prices have risen, their yields and prices per unit do not match the profitability of avocados. additionally, the grapefruit industry has been significantly affected by winter storms, and lemon production is at its lowest in five years, indicating potential risks in these markets. therefore, despite the challenges faced by the avocado industry, the high price per ton and strong market demand make avocados the most promising option for maximizing profit on your 10 acres of land in california."
