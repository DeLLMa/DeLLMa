    "decision": "action 2. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, we can calculate the expected revenue per acre for each fruit by multiplying the average yield per acre by the average price per unit. for avocados, the expected revenue per acre is 2.87 tons * $2,430/ton = $6,974.10. for grapes, it is 6.92 tons * $908/ton = $6,284.56. for peaches, the expected revenue per acre is 13.7 tons * $763/ton = $10,453.10. although peaches have the highest expected revenue per acre, we must consider the factors affecting the market and production. the report indicates that grape production is forecasted to be up despite drought and heat conditions, and the market for grapes is strong with higher shipments than the previous year. in contrast, avocado production has decreased due to wildfires and water restrictions, and while consumption is up, the u.s. market relies heavily on imports. peach production is up, but the forecast for processing clingstone peaches is down, which could affect overall profitability. considering the stability of grape production in the face of adverse weather conditions and the strong market performance, i recommend planting grapes on 10 acres as the most reliable option to maximize profit, despite the slightly lower expected revenue per acre compared to peaches. this decision is also influenced by the ongoing drought and water restrictions in california, which may have a more significant impact on water-intensive crops like avocados and peaches."
