    "decision": "action 1. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, the expected revenue from planting avocados is higher than that from pears. the average yield for avocados is 2.87 tons per acre with an average price of $2,430 per ton, while pears have an average yield of 15.6 tons per acre with an average price of $565 per ton. calculating the revenue per acre for each: avocado revenue per acre = 2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton = $6,971.1/acre. pear revenue per acre = 15.6 tons/acre * $565/ton = $8,814/acre. however, considering the total revenue for 10 acres: avocado total revenue = $6,971.1/acre * 10 acres = $69,711. pear total revenue = $8,814/acre * 10 acres = $88,140. although the total revenue for pears is higher, we must also consider the market trends and external factors. the report indicates a decrease in california avocado production due to wildfires and water restrictions, which could lead to higher prices due to scarcity. additionally, u.s. avocado consumption has increased significantly, and despite the imports, domestic production still has a market. on the other hand, pear production is forecasted to decline, and the impact of the northwest heat wave is uncertain, which could potentially harm yields. given the higher price per ton for avocados and the increasing market demand, coupled with the potential risks for pear production, it is recommended to plant avocados to maximize profit potential."
