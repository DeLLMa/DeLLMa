    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, the decision to plant avocados seems to be the most profitable for the following reasons: the average yield for avocados in california is 2.87 tons per acre, and the average price per unit is $2,430 per ton. when calculating the potential revenue per acre, avocados would yield $6,973.10 (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). multiplying this by 10 acres gives a total potential revenue of $69,731. this is significantly higher than the potential revenues from other fruits mentioned in the report. additionally, u.s. avocado consumption has increased significantly, and despite the decrease in california's production due to wildfires and water restrictions, the demand remains high, which is reflected in the strong price per ton. the report also indicates that imports from mexico and peru are growing, but california avocados have a market advantage due to their domestic origin, which can command higher prices and consumer preference. other fruits like apples, grapes, and peaches, while also having increased production, do not match the high revenue per acre of avocados. grapefruit and pear production face challenges that could affect yields, and the pear market is forecasted to decline. therefore, considering the high market price and strong demand for avocados, coupled with the relatively high yield per acre, avocados represent the best option for maximizing profit on your 10 acres of land in california."
