    "decision": "action 2. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, planting grapes appears to be the most profitable option for maximizing profit on 10 acres of land in california. the average grape yield is 6.92 tons / acre with an average price per unit of 908 $ / ton. when calculating the potential revenue per acre, grapes yield approximately 6,282.56 $ / acre (6.92 tons/acre * 908 $/ton). over 10 acres, this would equate to approximately 62,825.60 $ for the entire grape crop. in comparison, avocados would yield approximately 24,300 $ / acre (2.87 tons/acre * 2,430 $/ton), but given the decrease in california avocado production due to wildfires and water restrictions, there is a higher risk associated with this crop. grapefruit, peaches, and pears have lower yields and prices per unit than grapes, making them less profitable. grapefruit yields about 11,111.61 $ / acre (457 boxes/acre * 24.33 $/box), peaches yield about 10,454.10 $ / acre (13.7 tons/acre * 763 $/ton), and pears yield about 8,814 $ / acre (15.6 tons/acre * 565 $/ton). despite the challenges of drought and heat, grape production is forecasted to be up from the previous year, indicating a resilient crop under current conditions. therefore, action 2. grape: 10 acres is the recommended course of action."
