    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, the decision to plant avocados seems to be the most profitable for a few reasons. firstly, the average yield for avocados in california is 2.87 tons per acre, with an average price of $2,430 per ton. when calculated for 10 acres, the expected revenue would be 2.87 tons/acre * 10 acres * $2,430/ton = $69,681. secondly, despite the decrease in california avocado production due to wildfires and water restrictions, u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, and the market is heavily reliant on imports. this suggests a strong domestic demand for avocados, which could be beneficial if you were to increase local supply. additionally, the high price per unit for avocados indicates a strong market value. other fruits like apples, grapefruits, lemons, peaches, and pears either have lower prices per unit or are facing significant production challenges that could affect yield, such as extreme weather events, diseases, or decreased bearing acreage. therefore, planting avocados is recommended as it offers the highest potential revenue per acre among the options provided, coupled with a strong market demand."
