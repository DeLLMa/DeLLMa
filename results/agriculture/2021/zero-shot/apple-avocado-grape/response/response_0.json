    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report and the california price and yield statistics, we can calculate the expected revenue for each fruit per acre and then extrapolate that to 10 acres. for apples, the expected revenue per acre is 19,000 lb * 0.244 $/lb = 4,636 $. for avocados, the expected revenue per acre is 2.87 tons * 2,430 $/ton = 6,971.1 $. for grapes, the expected revenue per acre is 6.92 tons * 908 $/ton = 6,283.36 $. when we calculate these revenues for 10 acres, avocados yield the highest potential revenue (69,711 $), followed by grapes (62,833.6 $) and apples (46,360 $). therefore, based on the potential revenue, planting avocados would be the most profitable option. it is important to note that while the avocado yield has decreased due to wildfires and water restrictions, the consumption of avocados in the u.s. has increased significantly, and the price per unit is substantially higher than that of apples and grapes. this suggests that despite the lower yield, the high market price for avocados can still result in greater profit. however, the farmer should also consider the higher water needs and potential risks associated with avocados, such as the ongoing drought conditions in california, before making a final decision."
