    "decision": "action 4. peach: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, planting peaches appears to be the most profitable option. the average peach yield is 13.7 tons per acre with an average price of $763 per ton. over 10 acres, this would result in an expected yield of 137 tons and an expected revenue of $104,511. the peach production is forecasted to be up 13 percent from the previous year, potentially the largest crop since 2017, indicating a strong market and production conditions. while avocado has a higher price per unit, the yield per acre is lower, and the market is heavily dominated by imports, which could make it riskier. grapefruit and lemon both have lower yields and prices per unit compared to peaches, and they are facing significant production challenges such as weather damage and disease. pear production is stable, but the yield and price per unit are lower than peaches, resulting in less potential profit. therefore, considering the yield, price, and market conditions, peaches are the recommended crop to plant on your 10 acres of land to maximize profit."
