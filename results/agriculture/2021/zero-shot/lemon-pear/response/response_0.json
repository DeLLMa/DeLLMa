    "decision": "action 1. lemon: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, we can calculate the expected revenue for both lemons and pears per acre and then extrapolate that to 10 acres. for lemons, the average yield is 428 boxes per acre, and the average price per box is $23.3. this results in an expected revenue of 428 boxes/acre * $23.3/box = $9,972.4 per acre. for 10 acres, this would be $99,724. for pears, the average yield is 15.6 tons per acre, and the average price per ton is $565. this results in an expected revenue of 15.6 tons/acre * $565/ton = $8,814 per acre. for 10 acres, this would be $88,140. comparing the two, lemons are expected to yield higher revenue per acre than pears. additionally, the report indicates that lemon production is at its lowest in five years and grower prices have risen by 7 percent, which could potentially lead to even higher revenues if the trend continues. on the other hand, pear production is forecasted to be similar to the previous year and the impact of the northwest heat wave on production levels is still uncertain. therefore, based on the expected revenue and market conditions, planting lemons would be the more profitable action."
