    "decision": "action 2. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, grape production offers the highest potential profit per acre among the options. the average grape yield is 6.92 tons / acre with an average price per unit of 908 $ / ton. multiplying the yield by the price per ton gives us an expected revenue of 6.92 * 908 = 6,281.76 $ / acre. over 10 acres, this would result in a total expected revenue of 62,817.60 $. while avocado has a higher price per ton at 2,430 $ / ton, the yield is significantly lower at 2.87 tons / acre, resulting in an expected revenue of 2.87 * 2,430 = 6,974.10 $ / acre, or 69,741 $ for 10 acres. however, it's important to note that avocado production has decreased due to wildfires and water restrictions, which could further reduce yields and increase production costs. lemons, peaches, and pears have lower yields and prices per unit compared to grapes, resulting in lower expected revenues per acre. additionally, the grape market is forecasted to be up 9 percent from 2020 despite drought and heat conditions, indicating a strong market. therefore, planting grapes is the recommended action to maximize profit on the 10 acres of land available."
