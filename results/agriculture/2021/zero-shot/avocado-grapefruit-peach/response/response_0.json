    "decision": "action 1. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an expected revenue of $6,973.10 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). for 10 acres, this would be $69,731. grapefruits, on the other hand, have an average price of $24.33 per box with a yield of 457 boxes per acre, resulting in an expected revenue of $11,118.81 per acre (457 boxes/acre * $24.33/box), and $111,188.10 for 10 acres. peaches have an average price of $763 per ton with a yield of 13.7 tons per acre, leading to an expected revenue of $10,453.10 per acre (13.7 tons/acre * $763/ton), and $104,531 for 10 acres. despite the challenges faced by avocado production such as wildfires and water restrictions, the high price per unit and substantial consumption growth make avocados the most profitable option among the three. additionally, the reliance on imports due to decreased domestic production suggests a strong market for locally grown avocados."
