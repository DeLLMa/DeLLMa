    "decision": "action 2. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, planting grapes is expected to be more profitable than planting apples. the average yield for apples in california is 19,000 pounds per acre, with an average price of $0.244 per pound. this would result in an expected revenue of $4,636 per acre (19,000 lb x $0.244/lb). for 10 acres, the total expected revenue would be $46,360. in contrast, the average yield for grapes is 6.92 tons per acre, with an average price of $908 per ton. this would result in an expected revenue of $6,285.76 per acre (6.92 tons x $908/ton). for 10 acres, the total expected revenue would be $62,857.60. despite the challenges of drought and heat, grape production is forecasted to be up, and the price per unit is significantly higher than that of apples. additionally, the grape industry has shown resilience with increased shipments despite high heat and competition from imports. therefore, planting grapes on 10 acres of land is the recommended action to maximize profit."
