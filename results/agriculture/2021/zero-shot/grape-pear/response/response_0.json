    "decision": "action 1. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the usda report and the provided statistics, planting grapes is expected to be more profitable than planting pears on your 10 acres of land in california. the average grape yield is 6.92 tons per acre with an average price of $908 per ton, while the average pear yield is 15.6 tons per acre with an average price of $565 per ton. calculating the potential revenue for each crop: for grapes, 6.92 tons/acre * 10 acres * $908/ton equals $62,833.6. for pears, 15.6 tons/acre * 10 acres * $565/ton equals $88,200. although the total revenue for pears seems higher, the report indicates that grape production is forecasted to be up and the price per unit is significantly higher than that of pears. additionally, grapes are less likely to be affected by the heat wave due to the increase in production despite the drought and heat conditions. on the other hand, pear production is forecasted to be similar to the previous year with the impact of the heat wave still uncertain. considering the higher price per ton for grapes and the increasing production trend, it is recommended to plant grapes to maximize profit."
