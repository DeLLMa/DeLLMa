    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest price per unit at 2,430 $ / ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons / acre. when calculating the potential revenue per acre, avocados would yield approximately 6,974.10 $ / acre (2.87 tons / acre * 2,430 $ / ton). multiplying this by 10 acres gives a total of 69,741 $ for avocados. in comparison, apples would yield approximately 4,636 $ / acre (19,000 lb / acre * 0.244 $ / lb), peaches would yield approximately 10,454.10 $ / acre (13.7 tons / acre * 763 $ / ton), and pears would yield approximately 8,814 $ / acre (15.6 tons / acre * 565 $ / ton). therefore, avocados are expected to bring in the highest revenue per acre among the options provided. additionally, the report indicates that u.s. avocado consumption has increased significantly, and despite the decrease in california production due to wildfires and water restrictions, the market demand remains high. this suggests that avocados are likely to maintain or even increase their profitability. the other fruits, while also profitable, do not offer as high a return per acre as avocados. it is important to note that while avocados have the highest potential revenue, they may also require more intensive water management, which is a consideration given california's ongoing drought. however, the high market price and increased consumption of avocados make them the most profitable option among those listed."
