    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton. although the yield per acre is lower than some other fruits at 2.87 tons per acre, the high price per ton makes it the most profitable option. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an expected revenue of $6,973.10 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton), which is higher than the other fruits. apples, grapes, peaches, and pears have lower expected revenues per acre when considering their respective yields and prices per unit. additionally, the report indicates that u.s. avocado consumption has increased significantly, and despite the decrease in california's production due to wildfires and water restrictions, the demand remains high. this suggests that avocados are a lucrative crop with a growing market, making them a good choice for maximizing profit on your 10 acres of land."
