    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report and the california price and yield statistics, we can calculate the expected revenue for each fruit per acre and then extrapolate that to 10 acres. for apples, the average yield is 19,000 lb / acre with a price of 0.244 $ / lb, which would result in a revenue of 19,000 * 0.244 = $4,636 per acre, or $46,360 for 10 acres. for avocados, the average yield is 2.87 tons / acre with a price of 2,430 $ / ton, resulting in a revenue of 2.87 * 2,430 = $6,971.1 per acre, or $69,711 for 10 acres. for grapefruit, the average yield is 457 boxes / acre with a price of 24.33 $ / box, on tree equiv, which would result in a revenue of 457 * 24.33 = $11,117.81 per acre, or $111,178.1 for 10 acres. however, the grapefruit market has been significantly affected by winter storm uri and citrus greening disease, leading to lower production levels and increased reliance on imports, which could introduce more risk and potential for price volatility. apples have concerns over heat damage and a potentially sluggish export market, which could push more supply into the domestic market and lower prices. avocados, despite decreased production in california due to wildfires and water restrictions, have seen a significant increase in u.s. consumption, and the market is bolstered by imports. given the higher average revenue per acre and the strong market demand, avocados appear to be the most profitable and least risky option among the three, making action 2 the recommended course of action."
