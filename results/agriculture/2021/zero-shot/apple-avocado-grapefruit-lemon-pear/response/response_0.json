    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, the decision to plant avocados seems to be the most profitable for the following reasons: the average yield for avocados in california is 2.87 tons per acre, and the average price per ton is $2,430. when calculating the potential revenue per acre, avocados yield $6,973.10 (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). multiplying this by 10 acres gives a total potential revenue of $69,731. despite the challenges of wildfires and water restrictions, u.s. avocado consumption has increased significantly, and the market is heavily supported by imports, indicating strong demand. in comparison, apples, grapefruits, lemons, and pears have lower yields and prices per unit area, and they face various challenges such as heat damage, disease, and increased competition from imports. for instance, apples have a yield of 19,000 lbs per acre and a price of $0.244 per lb, resulting in a potential revenue of $4,636 per acre, which is significantly lower than that of avocados. grapefruits and lemons have also seen production declines and increased imports, which could affect domestic prices negatively. pears have a yield of 15.6 tons per acre and a price of $565 per ton, resulting in a potential revenue of $8,814 per acre, which is higher than other fruits but still lower than avocados. therefore, considering the high yield and price of avocados along with the strong market demand, planting avocados is the recommended action."
