    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an expected revenue of $6,973.10 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). over 10 acres, this would equate to $69,731. for apples, the average yield is 19,000 lbs per acre with a price of $0.244 per lb, resulting in an expected revenue of $4,636 per acre (19,000 lbs/acre * $0.244/lb), or $46,360 over 10 acres. peaches have an average yield of 13.7 tons per acre with a price of $763 per ton, leading to an expected revenue of $10,452.10 per acre (13.7 tons/acre * $763/ton), or $104,521 over 10 acres. despite peaches having a higher total revenue over 10 acres, the report indicates a potential oversupply with the largest crop since 2017, which could drive prices down. avocados, on the other hand, have seen increased consumption and reduced local production due to wildfires and water restrictions, which could keep prices stable or even increase them. therefore, planting avocados is recommended as it offers a high price per unit and a stable market due to growing demand and reduced local supply, which could maximize profit on the 10 acres of land."
