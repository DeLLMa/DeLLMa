    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an expected revenue of $6,971.10 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). over 10 acres, this would equate to $69,711.00. in comparison, apples yield 19,000 lbs (or 9.5 tons) per acre at $0.244 per lb (or $488 per ton), which results in $4,636 per acre or $46,360 over 10 acres. grapes have an average yield of 6.92 tons per acre at $908 per ton, totaling $6,282.56 per acre or $62,825.60 for 10 acres. lemons yield 428 boxes per acre at $23.3 per box, which is $9,973.40 per acre or $99,734.00 for 10 acres. however, lemon production is at its lowest in five years, and the market is uncertain due to increased imports and decreased exports. peaches yield 13.7 tons per acre at $763 per ton, which results in $10,452.10 per acre or $104,521.00 for 10 acres. despite peaches having a higher potential revenue than avocados, the report indicates that california's forecast for processing clingstone peaches is down, which could affect overall peach prices negatively. additionally, avocados have seen a significant increase in u.s. consumption, and with california's production decreasing due to wildfires and water restrictions, the supply may be limited, potentially keeping prices high. therefore, planting avocados is recommended as it offers a high price per unit and a stable market demand, despite the lower yield compared to some other fruits."
