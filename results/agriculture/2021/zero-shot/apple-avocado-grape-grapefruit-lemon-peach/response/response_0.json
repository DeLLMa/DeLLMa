    "decision": "action 3. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, grape production is forecasted to be up 9 percent from 2020 despite drought and heat conditions, indicating a resilient crop. the average grape yield in california is 6.92 tons / acre with an average price per unit of 908 $ / ton. multiplying the yield by the price per unit and then by 10 acres, we get an expected revenue of 6.92 * 908 * 10 = $62,833.6 per 10 acres, which is the highest among the options provided. while there are concerns about heat affecting the industry, the report indicates that shipments are up, suggesting a strong market for grapes. additionally, the decrease in imports from mexico, the main competitor, could mean less competition in the market. the other fruits either have lower yields or prices per unit, or they face significant challenges such as heat damage, water restrictions, and diseases that could affect their yields and profitability. therefore, planting grapes on 10 acres of land is the recommended action to maximize profit."
