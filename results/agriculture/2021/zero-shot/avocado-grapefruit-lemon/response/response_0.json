    "decision": "action 1. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an average revenue of $6,973.10 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). for 10 acres, this would be $69,731. despite the decrease in california avocado production due to wildfires and water restrictions, the u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, and the market is largely supplemented by imports, indicating a strong demand. grapefruits and lemons have lower average prices per unit and yields. grapefruit yields 457 boxes per acre at $24.33 per box, which equals $11,118.81 per acre (457 boxes/acre * $24.33/box), and for 10 acres, it would be $111,188.10. lemons yield 428 boxes per acre at $23.3 per box, which equals $9,974.40 per acre (428 boxes/acre * $23.3/box), and for 10 acres, it would be $99,744. although grapefruit and lemon prices have risen, their lower yields and prices per unit compared to avocados suggest that avocados would be the most profitable crop to plant on your 10 acres of land in california."
