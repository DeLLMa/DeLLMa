    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, the decision to plant avocados seems to be the most profitable for the following reasons: the average yield for avocados in california is 2.87 tons per acre, and the average price per ton is $2,430. this suggests a high return per acre compared to the other fruits. despite the decrease in california avocado production due to wildfires and water restrictions, u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, indicating strong market demand. additionally, while imports from mexico and peru are substantial, the report does not indicate an oversupply that would drive prices down. in contrast, apple production is up, but there is concern over heat damage and potential price decreases due to a sluggish export market. grapefruit production has been halved due to winter storms, and lemon production is at its lowest in five years, with increased imports and decreased exports. both of these factors could lead to increased competition and potentially lower prices. therefore, avocados present a more favorable balance of high market prices and strong demand, which is likely to result in higher profitability on your 10 acres of land in california."
