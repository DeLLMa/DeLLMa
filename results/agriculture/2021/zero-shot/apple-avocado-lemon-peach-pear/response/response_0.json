    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an average revenue of $6,974.1 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). over 10 acres, this would equate to $69,741 in revenue. while there are concerns about wildfires and water restrictions impacting yields, the u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, and the market is heavily supported by imports, indicating strong demand. the other fruits, while having higher yields, do not command as high a price per unit as avocados, resulting in lower revenue per acre. for example, apples have an average yield of 19,000 lbs per acre and a price of $0.244 per lb, which results in $4,636 in revenue per acre, significantly less than avocados. lemons, peaches, and pears also have lower revenue per acre when compared to avocados. therefore, despite potential risks, avocados are likely to offer the highest profit per acre on your 10 acres of land in california."
