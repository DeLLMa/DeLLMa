    "decision": "action 1. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an average revenue of $6,973.10 per acre. for 10 acres, this would be $69,731. grapefruits, peaches, and pears have lower average prices per unit and yields. grapefruits yield 457 boxes per acre at $24.33 per box, resulting in $11,118.81 per acre, or $111,188.10 for 10 acres. peaches yield 13.7 tons per acre at $763 per ton, resulting in $10,452.10 per acre, or $104,521 for 10 acres. pears yield 15.6 tons per acre at $565 per ton, resulting in $8,814 per acre, or $88,140 for 10 acres. despite the challenges faced by the avocado industry, such as wildfires and water restrictions, the high price per unit and significant u.s. consumption, along with substantial imports, indicate a strong market for avocados. therefore, planting avocados is expected to yield the highest profit among the options provided."
