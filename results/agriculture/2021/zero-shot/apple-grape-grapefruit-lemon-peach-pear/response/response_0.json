    "decision": "action 2. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, grape production in california is forecasted to be up 9 percent from 2020 despite drought and heat conditions, indicating a strong year for grapes. the average grape yield is 6.92 tons / acre with an average price per unit of 908 $ / ton. multiplying the yield by the price per unit and then by 10 acres, we get an expected revenue of 6.92 * 908 * 10 = $62,833.60. this is the highest expected revenue among the options provided. while there are concerns about heat affecting the crop, the report suggests that the industry has still managed to increase shipments, and with imports from mexico down slightly, there may be less competition in the market. additionally, the high consumer price index for fresh fruit suggests that retail prices for grapes are likely to be higher, which could further increase revenue. therefore, planting grapes on 10 acres of land is the recommended action to maximize profit based on the available data."
