    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an average revenue of $6,971.10 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). over 10 acres, this would equate to $69,711. despite challenges such as wildfires and water restrictions, u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, and the market is supported by imports, indicating strong demand. in contrast, apples, while having an increased production forecast, face potential price decreases due to a possible oversupply in the domestic market and export challenges. grapefruit production has been halved in texas and is facing challenges in florida, leading to increased imports and higher prices, but the yield in california is lower compared to avocados. peaches have a forecasted increase in production, which could lead to a good supply, but the price per unit is significantly lower than that of avocados at $763 per ton, and the yield is 13.7 tons per acre, resulting in an average revenue of $10,453.1 per acre (13.7 tons/acre * $763/ton), which is higher than avocados but considering the market challenges and the higher costs associated with peach production, avocados still present a more profitable option. therefore, planting avocados is the recommended action to maximize profit on the 10 acres of land available."
