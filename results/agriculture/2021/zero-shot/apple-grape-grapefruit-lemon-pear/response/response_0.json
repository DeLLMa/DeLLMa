    "decision": "action 2. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, grape production appears to be the most profitable option for your 10 acres of land in california. the average grape yield is 6.92 tons per acre, and the average price per unit is $908 per ton. multiplying the yield by the price per unit and then by the total acreage, we get an expected revenue of $62,833.6 per acre, or $628,336 for 10 acres. this is significantly higher than the other fruits listed. while apple and pear yields are also high, their prices per unit are much lower, resulting in less revenue per acre. grapefruit and lemon have higher prices per unit, but their yields per acre are lower than grapes, which also leads to lower total revenue. additionally, grape production is forecasted to be up from the previous year despite drought and heat conditions, indicating a resilient crop. the increase in california table-type grape production suggests a favorable market for grapes. although high heat has affected the industry, overall shipments were higher in 2021 than the previous year, indicating strong demand. therefore, planting grapes is the recommended action based on the expected yield, price, and market conditions."
