    "decision": "action 2. peach: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, planting peaches appears to be the most profitable option. the average peach yield is 13.7 tons / acre with an average price of 763 $ / ton. over 10 acres, this would result in an expected yield of 137 tons and an expected revenue of 104,511 $ (137 tons * 763 $ / ton). in comparison, avocados would yield 28.7 tons over 10 acres with a revenue of 69,741 $ (28.7 tons * 2,430 $ / ton), and pears would yield 156 tons over 10 acres with a revenue of 88,140 $ (156 tons * 565 $ / ton). while avocados have a higher price per ton, the significantly lower yield results in less overall revenue than peaches. pears have the highest yield but the lowest price per ton, resulting in less revenue than peaches. additionally, the peach market is forecasted to be up 13 percent from the previous year, potentially indicating a strong market demand. california's ongoing drought and the impact of the northwest heat dome introduce uncertainties in production, but peaches have shown resilience with an expected increase in production. therefore, planting peaches is recommended to maximize profit on the 10 acres of land."
