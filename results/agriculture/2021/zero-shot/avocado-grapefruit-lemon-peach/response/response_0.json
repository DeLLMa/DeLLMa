    "decision": "action 1. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an expected revenue of $6,973.10 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). for 10 acres, this would be $69,731. despite the decrease in california avocado production due to wildfires and water restrictions, the u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, and the market is heavily supplemented by imports, indicating a strong demand. the high price per unit and the increased consumption suggest that avocados could be the most profitable option among the choices. grapefruit, lemon, and peach have lower prices per unit and yields that do not surpass the expected revenue from avocados. grapefruit and lemon production have been affected by adverse weather conditions and diseases, which may introduce more risk. although peach production is up, the price per unit is significantly lower than that of avocados, resulting in less revenue per acre. therefore, planting avocados is the recommended action to maximize profit on the 10 acres of land."
