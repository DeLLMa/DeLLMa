    "decision": "action 2. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, the expected yield and price per unit for avocados are 2.87 tons per acre and $2,430 per ton, respectively. for grapes, the expected yield is 6.92 tons per acre with a price of $908 per ton. to calculate the expected revenue for each crop, we multiply the yield per acre by the price per ton and then by the total acreage. for avocados, the expected revenue would be 2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton * 10 acres = $69,681. for grapes, the expected revenue would be 6.92 tons/acre * $908/ton * 10 acres = $62,833.6. although avocados have a higher price per ton, the significantly higher yield of grapes per acre makes grape production more profitable on a per-acre basis. additionally, the grape production is forecasted to be up despite the drought and heat conditions, indicating a resilient crop under current conditions. in contrast, avocado production has decreased due to wildfires and water restrictions, which may pose a higher risk. therefore, planting grapes is recommended to maximize profit on the 10 acres of land."
