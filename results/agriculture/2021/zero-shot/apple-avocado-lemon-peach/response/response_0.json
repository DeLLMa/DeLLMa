    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an expected revenue of $6,973.10 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). over 10 acres, this would equate to $69,731. despite the challenges such as wildfires and water restrictions, the u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, and the market is heavily supported by imports, indicating strong demand. in comparison, apples have a lower price per unit at $0.244 per pound with an average yield of 19,000 pounds per acre, resulting in an expected revenue of $4,636 per acre. lemons have an average price of $23.3 per box with a yield of 428 boxes per acre, leading to an expected revenue of $9,972.4 per acre. peaches have an average price of $763 per ton with a yield of 13.7 tons per acre, resulting in an expected revenue of $10,453.1 per acre. although peaches have a higher expected revenue per acre than avocados, the report indicates a potential oversupply with the largest crop since 2017, which could drive prices down. therefore, considering the high price per unit of avocados, the increasing consumption, and the import reliance, avocados are likely to offer the highest profit potential for your 10 acres of land in california."
