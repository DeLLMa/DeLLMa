    "decision": "action 1. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an average revenue of $6,973.10 per acre. for 10 acres, this would result in an estimated revenue of $69,731. grapefruits, lemons, and pears have lower prices per unit and yields. grapefruits yield 457 boxes per acre at $24.33 per box, resulting in $11,118.81 per acre. lemons yield 428 boxes per acre at $23.3 per box, resulting in $9,970.4 per acre. pears yield 15.6 tons per acre at $565 per ton, resulting in $8,814 per acre. despite the challenges faced by the avocado industry such as wildfires and water restrictions, the high price per unit and significant u.s. consumption, along with substantial imports, indicate a strong market demand. therefore, planting avocados is expected to maximize profit on your 10 acres of land in california."
