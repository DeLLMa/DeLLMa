    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest price per unit at 2,430 $ / ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons / acre. over 10 acres, this would equate to an expected revenue of 2,430 $ / ton * 2.87 tons / acre * 10 acre = 69,741 $. in comparison, apples have a lower price per unit at 0.244 $ / lb with an average yield of 19,000 lb / acre, which would result in 19,000 lb / acre * 0.244 $ / lb * 10 acre = 46,360 $. grapes have a price per unit of 908 $ / ton with an average yield of 6.92 tons / acre, leading to a revenue of 908 $ / ton * 6.92 tons / acre * 10 acre = 62,857.6 $. lastly, grapefruits have a price per unit of 24.33 $ / box with an average yield of 457 boxes / acre, which would amount to 24.33 $ / box * 457 boxes / acre * 10 acre = 111,150.1 $. however, it is important to note that grapefruit production has been significantly affected by winter storm uri and citrus greening disease, which could lead to lower yields and higher risks. considering the high price per unit and stable demand for avocados, along with the significant u.s. consumption and import reliance, avocado cultivation on 10 acres is likely to maximize profit while minimizing risk compared to the other options."
