    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at 2,430 $ / ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons / acre. over 10 acres, this would equate to an expected revenue of 2,430 $ / ton * 2.87 tons / acre * 10 acre = 69,741 $, which is the highest among the options provided. although california avocado production has decreased due to wildfires and water restrictions, u.s. consumption has increased significantly, and the market is supported by imports, indicating strong demand. the high price per unit and strong market demand make avocados the most profitable option among the fruits listed. other fruits like apples, grapes, peaches, and pears have lower prices per unit and yields that do not compensate for the higher price per unit of avocados. lemons, while having a high price per unit, have a lower yield per acre, resulting in lower expected revenue than avocados. additionally, the report indicates that avocado imports peak during the summer months, which suggests that there is a window of opportunity for domestic production to capture more of the market during other times of the year."
