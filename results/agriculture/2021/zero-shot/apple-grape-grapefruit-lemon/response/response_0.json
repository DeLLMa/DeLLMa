    "decision": "action 2. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the usda report and the provided yield and price statistics for california, planting grapes appears to be the most profitable option. the average grape yield is 6.92 tons per acre, and the average price per ton is $908. when calculated for 10 acres, the expected revenue from grapes would be 6.92 tons/acre * 10 acres * $908/ton, which equals $62,833.6. in comparison, apples yield 19,000 lbs per acre at $0.244 per lb, totaling $46,360 for 10 acres. grapefruits and lemons have higher prices per box, but their yields per acre are lower than grapes, and they are also facing significant production challenges such as disease and weather damage that could affect yields and prices negatively. additionally, the grape market is forecasted to be up 9 percent from 2020 despite drought and heat conditions, indicating a strong market demand. therefore, taking into account the current market conditions, expected yields, and prices, grapes are the recommended crop to maximize profit on your 10 acres of land in california."
