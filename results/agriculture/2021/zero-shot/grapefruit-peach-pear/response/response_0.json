    "decision": "action 2. peach: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, planting peaches appears to be the most profitable option. the average yield for peaches is 13.7 tons per acre, and the average price per ton is $763. multiplying the yield by the price per ton and then by the total acreage (10 acres), the expected revenue from peaches would be 13.7 tons/acre * $763/ton * 10 acres = $104,531. the peach production is also forecasted to be up 13 percent from the previous year, which could potentially be the largest crop since 2017, indicating a strong market and production conditions. in contrast, grapefruit has been significantly affected by winter storms, and the citrus greening disease has led to lower production levels, which makes it a riskier choice despite the high price per box. pear production is forecasted to be similar to the previous year, but the yield and price per ton for pears are lower than for peaches, at 15.6 tons per acre and $565 per ton, respectively, which would result in an expected revenue of 15.6 tons/acre * $565/ton * 10 acres = $88,140. therefore, peaches are the recommended crop to plant to maximize profit on your 10 acres of land in california."
