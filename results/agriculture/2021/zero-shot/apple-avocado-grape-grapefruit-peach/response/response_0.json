    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an expected revenue of $6,973.10 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). over 10 acres, this would equate to $69,731. despite the challenges such as wildfires and water restrictions, the u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, and the market is heavily supported by imports, indicating a strong demand. the high price per unit and the strong market demand make avocados the most profitable option among the choices. in contrast, apples, grapes, grapefruits, and peaches have lower expected revenues per acre. for example, apples at $0.244 per pound would yield $4,636 per acre (19,000 lb/acre * $0.244/lb), grapes at $908 per ton would yield $6,287.36 per acre (6.92 tons/acre * $908/ton), grapefruits at $24.33 per box would yield $11,116.91 per acre (457 boxes/acre * $24.33/box), and peaches at $763 per ton would yield $10,453.10 per acre (13.7 tons/acre * $763/ton). therefore, avocados are expected to be the most profitable crop to plant on your 10 acres of land in california."
