    "decision": "action 2. peach: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, the expected yield for lemons is 428 boxes per acre with an average price of $23.3 per box. for peaches, the expected yield is 13.7 tons per acre with an average price of $763 per ton. to determine the potential revenue for each crop, we can calculate the revenue per acre and then for 10 acres. for lemons, the revenue per acre would be 428 boxes * $23.3 = $9,974.4. for peaches, the revenue per acre would be 13.7 tons * $763 = $10,453.1. when we scale this up to 10 acres, lemons would yield approximately $99,744, while peaches would yield approximately $104,531. additionally, the report indicates that peach production is forecasted to be up 13 percent from the previous year, which could be the largest crop since 2017, suggesting a strong market and potential for good sales. on the other hand, lemon production is at its lowest in five years, and there has been a 6 percent decrease for the fresh market, which could indicate potential challenges in selling the produce at the higher prices needed to make up for the lower yield. considering the higher expected revenue and the positive outlook for peach production, the recommendation is to plant peaches on the 10 acres of land."
