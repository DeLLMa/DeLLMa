    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an expected revenue of $6,973.10 per acre. over 10 acres, this would result in an expected revenue of $69,731. despite the challenges of wildfires and water restrictions, the u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, and the market is heavily supported by imports, indicating strong demand. in comparison, other fruits either have lower prices per unit, lower yields, or are facing significant production challenges that could affect yield and quality. for example, apple production is up but faces potential price decreases due to an oversupply in the domestic market. grapes have a lower expected revenue per acre at $6,289.36, and both grapefruit and lemon production have been negatively impacted by weather events and diseases, which could pose a risk to yields. pear production is relatively stable but offers a lower expected revenue per acre at $8,814 compared to avocados. therefore, planting avocados is the recommended action to maximize profit on your 10 acres of land in california."
