    "decision": "action 1. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an expected revenue of $6,973.10 per acre. for 10 acres, this would be $69,731. lemons, on the other hand, have an average price of $23.3 per box with a yield of 428 boxes per acre, resulting in an expected revenue of $9,974.4 per acre, or $99,744 for 10 acres. pears have an average price of $565 per ton with a yield of 15.6 tons per acre, leading to an expected revenue of $8,814 per acre, or $88,140 for 10 acres. while lemons have the highest expected revenue per 10 acres, the market for lemons is currently experiencing a decrease in production and an increase in imports, which could potentially saturate the market and drive prices down. avocados, despite a decrease in california production, have seen a significant increase in consumption and the market is heavily reliant on imports, suggesting a strong domestic market for locally produced avocados. therefore, considering the high price per unit, increased consumption, and potential market for local produce, planting avocados is recommended to maximize profit."
