    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, the decision to plant avocados seems to be the most profitable for the following reasons: the average yield for avocados is 2.87 tons per acre, and the average price per ton is $2,430. this suggests a high revenue potential per acre. despite the decrease in california avocado production due to wildfires and water restrictions, u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, indicating strong market demand. additionally, while there are concerns about import competition, the report does not indicate that this has negatively impacted the price, which remains high. in contrast, apple production is facing uncertainty due to heat damage and potential price decreases due to a sluggish export market and increased domestic supply. the lemon market is also experiencing challenges with a decrease in production and increased imports, which could potentially pressure domestic prices despite the current increase in grower prices. therefore, considering the high price per unit and strong market demand for avocados, coupled with the challenges facing apples and lemons, planting avocados on 10 acres of land is recommended to maximize profit."
