    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us an expected revenue of $6,971.10 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). over 10 acres, this would equate to $69,711.00. in comparison, apples yield 19,000 lbs (or 9.5 tons) per acre at $0.244 per lb, which is approximately $2,318 per acre or $23,180 over 10 acres. grapes have an average yield of 6.92 tons per acre at $908 per ton, resulting in $6,282.56 per acre or $62,825.60 for 10 acres. lemons yield 428 boxes per acre at $23.3 per box, which is approximately $9,974.40 per acre or $99,744.00 for 10 acres. pears yield 15.6 tons per acre at $565 per ton, which is $8,814 per acre or $88,140 for 10 acres. while lemons have a higher revenue per acre than avocados, the report indicates a decrease in lemon production and an increase in grower prices, which could be due to lower yields in the future. avocado consumption is on the rise, and despite lower production in california, the market is supplemented by imports, indicating a strong demand. therefore, considering the high price per unit, strong market demand, and the substantial yield per acre, avocados are the most profitable option among the choices given."
