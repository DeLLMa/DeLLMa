    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, the decision to plant avocados seems to be the most profitable for the following reasons: the average yield for avocados is 2.87 tons per acre, and the average price per ton is $2,430. when calculated for 10 acres, the expected revenue would be 2.87 tons/acre * 10 acres * $2,430/ton = $69,681. the demand for avocados in the u.s. has increased significantly, and despite the decrease in california's production due to wildfires and water restrictions, the market price remains high, which suggests a strong market for avocados. in contrast, apple production is up, but prices may be lower due to more apples entering the domestic market. grape production is also up, but the industry has been affected by high heat. lemon production is at its lowest in five years, and while prices have risen, the yield is lower than avocados when considering the price per unit and the average yield. therefore, avocados present the highest potential for profit on your 10 acres of land in california."
