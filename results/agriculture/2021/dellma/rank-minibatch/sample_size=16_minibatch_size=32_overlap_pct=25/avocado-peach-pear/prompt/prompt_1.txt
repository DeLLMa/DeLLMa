Below is an agriculture report published by the USDA. It gives an overview of the fruit and nut market in the United States, with an additional focus on information pertaining to avocado, peach, pear.

Market Overview: the usda report indicates a general increase in u.s. production of major noncitrus fruits for 2021, with apples, grapes, peaches, cranberries, and sweet and tart cherries seeing a rise in production, while pear production is forecasted to decline. the impact of extreme weather events and california's ongoing drought on crop yields is uncertain. fruit and tree nut grower price indices remain high, with fluctuations throughout 2021. the consumer price index for fresh fruit also increased, suggesting higher retail prices. the northwest heat dome has introduced production uncertainty, particularly for tree fruits. the u.s. citrus season ended with declines in all commodities except california tangerines, and citrus prices are higher. tree nut supplies are forecasted to be down from the previous year's record, with smaller almond and walnut crops expected to increase grower prices. factors such as weather conditions, supply chain issues, and demand are influencing the market.

- avocado:
    - Product Summary: california avocado production has decreased, with wildfires and water restrictions impacting yields. however, u.s. avocado consumption has increased significantly, with imports from mexico and peru growing substantially. mexico dominates the u.s. avocado market, with imports peaking from may through july. peruvian imports compete during the summer months, traditionally a period of lower mexican imports.
    - California Price and Yield Statistics: the average avocado yield is 2.87 TONS / ACRE and the average price per unit is 2,430 $ / TON.
- peach:
    - Product Summary: peach production is forecasted to be up 13 percent from the previous year, potentially the largest crop since 2017. california, south carolina, and georgia all expect increases in production despite weather challenges. however, california's forecast for processing clingstone peaches is down 3 percent from the previous year.
    - California Price and Yield Statistics: the average peach yield is 13.7 TONS / ACRE and the average price per unit is 763 $ / TON.
- pear:
    - Product Summary: pear production is forecasted to be similar to the previous year, with losses in washington but gains in oregon and california. the impact of the northwest heat wave on production levels is still uncertain, but traditional pear trees with large canopies may offer some protection from heat damage.
    - California Price and Yield Statistics: the average pear yield is 15.6 TONS / ACRE and the average price per unit is 565 $ / TON.

I'm a farmer in California planning what fruit to plant next year. I would like to maximize my profit with '10' acres of land.

Below are the actions I can take:
Action 1. avocado: 10 acres
Action 2. peach: 10 acres
Action 3. pear: 10 acres

I would like to adopt a decision making under uncertainty framework to make my decision. The goal of you, the decision maker, is to choose an optimal action, while accounting for uncertainty in the unknown state. Previously, you have already provided a forecast of future state variables relevant to planting decisions. The state is a vector of 16 elements, each of which is a random variable. The state variables (and their most probable values) are enumerated below:
- climate condition: {'continued drought': 'very likely', 'mild improvement': 'somewhat likely', 'significant improvement': 'unlikely'}
- supply chain disruptions: {'minor disruptions': 'somewhat likely', 'moderate disruptions': 'likely', 'severe disruptions': 'somewhat unlikely'}
- avocado price change: {'increase': 'likely', 'no change': 'somewhat likely', 'decrease': 'unlikely'}
- avocado yield change: {'increase': 'unlikely', 'no change': 'somewhat likely', 'decrease': 'likely'}
- peach price change: {'increase': 'somewhat likely', 'no change': 'likely', 'decrease': 'somewhat unlikely'}
- peach yield change: {'increase': 'somewhat likely', 'no change': 'likely', 'decrease': 'somewhat unlikely'}
- pear price change: {'increase': 'somewhat likely', 'no change': 'likely', 'decrease': 'somewhat unlikely'}
- pear yield change: {'increase': 'somewhat unlikely', 'no change': 'somewhat likely', 'decrease': 'likely'}

You should format your response as a JSON object. The JSON object should contain the following keys:
- decision: a string that describes the state-action pair you recommend the farmer to take. The output format should be the same as the format of the state-action pairs listed above, e.g. State-Action Pair 5.
- rank: a list of integers that ranks the state-action pairs in decreasing rank of preference. For example, if you think the first state-action pair is the most preferred, the second state-action pair is the second most preferred, and so on. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
- explanation: a string that describes, in detail, the reasoning behind your decision. You should include information on the expected yield and price of each fruit, as well as factors that affect them.
