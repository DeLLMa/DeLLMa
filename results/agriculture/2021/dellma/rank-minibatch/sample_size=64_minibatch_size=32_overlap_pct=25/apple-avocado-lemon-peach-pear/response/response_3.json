    "explanation": "the decision to recommend state-action pair 26 is based on the combination of favorable conditions for avocado production and market dynamics. the state indicates a continued drought, which is very likely, and minor supply chain disruptions, which are somewhat likely. the avocado price change is expected to increase, which is likely, and the avocado yield change is expected to increase, which is unlikely but favorable if it occurs. given the high average price per unit for avocados ($2,430 per ton) and the relatively good yield (2.87 tons per acre), the potential for increased prices and yields makes this a particularly attractive option. additionally, the increase in u.s. avocado consumption and the reliance on imports suggest a strong domestic market for locally grown avocados. the other state-action pairs were ranked based on similar considerations of expected yield changes, price changes, and the overall market conditions for each fruit. pairs with expected increases in both price and yield were ranked higher, while those with decreases or unfavorable conditions were ranked lower."
