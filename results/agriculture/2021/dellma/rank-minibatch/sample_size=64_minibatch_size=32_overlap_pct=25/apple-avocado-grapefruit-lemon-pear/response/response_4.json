    "explanation": "the decision to recommend state-action pair 10 is based on the combination of high expected prices for avocados, a mild improvement in climate conditions, and moderate supply chain disruptions. the average avocado yield in california is 2.87 tons / acre with an average price per unit of 2,430 $ / ton, which is significantly higher than the other fruits. although the avocado yield change is expected to decrease, the price change is expected to remain stable or increase, which could compensate for the lower yield. additionally, avocados have a strong market demand, and with the ongoing drought, the water-efficient avocado trees might be a more resilient choice compared to other fruits that may require more water. the ranking of the state-action pairs takes into account the likelihood of price increases, yield stability, and the impact of climate and supply chain disruptions on each fruit type. pairs with higher expected prices and more stable yields are ranked higher, while those with decreasing prices and yields are ranked lower."
