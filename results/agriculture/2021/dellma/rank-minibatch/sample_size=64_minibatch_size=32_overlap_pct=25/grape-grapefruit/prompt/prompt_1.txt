Below is an agriculture report published by the USDA. It gives an overview of the fruit and nut market in the United States, with an additional focus on information pertaining to grape, grapefruit.

Market Overview: the usda report indicates a general increase in u.s. production of major noncitrus fruits for 2021, with apples, grapes, peaches, cranberries, and sweet and tart cherries seeing a rise in production, while pear production is forecasted to decline. the impact of extreme weather events and california's ongoing drought on crop yields is uncertain. fruit and tree nut grower price indices remain high, with fluctuations throughout 2021. the consumer price index for fresh fruit also increased, suggesting higher retail prices. the northwest heat dome has introduced production uncertainty, particularly for tree fruits. the u.s. citrus season ended with declines in all commodities except california tangerines, and citrus prices are higher. tree nut supplies are forecasted to be down from the previous year's record, with smaller almond and walnut crops expected to increase grower prices. factors such as weather conditions, supply chain issues, and demand are influencing the market.

- grape:
    - Product Summary: grape production is forecasted to be up 9 percent from 2020, despite drought and heat conditions. california table-type grape production is also expected to increase. high heat has affected the industry, with coachella valley shipments down and central california shipments up. imports from mexico, the main competitor, were down slightly, but overall shipments were higher in 2021 than the previous year.
    - California Price and Yield Statistics: the average grape yield is 6.92 TONS / ACRE and the average price per unit is 908 $ / TON.
- grapefruit:
    - Product Summary: grapefruit production has been significantly affected by winter storm uri in texas, reducing the crop to half the volume predicted. florida continues to lead in grapefruit production, but the impact of citrus greening disease and decreased bearing acreage has led to lower production levels. with reduced domestic production, imports have increased, and the average price for grapefruit has risen.
    - California Price and Yield Statistics: the average grapefruit yield is 457 BOXES / ACRE and the average price per unit is 24.33 $ / BOX, ON TREE EQUIV.

I'm a farmer in California planning what fruit to plant next year. I would like to maximize my profit with '10' acres of land.

Below are the actions I can take:
Action 1. grape: 10 acres
Action 2. grapefruit: 10 acres

I would like to adopt a decision making under uncertainty framework to make my decision. The goal of you, the decision maker, is to choose an optimal action, while accounting for uncertainty in the unknown state. Previously, you have already provided a forecast of future state variables relevant to planting decisions. The state is a vector of 16 elements, each of which is a random variable. The state variables (and their most probable values) are enumerated below:
- climate condition: {'continued drought': 'very likely', 'mild improvement': 'somewhat likely', 'significant improvement': 'unlikely'}
- supply chain disruptions: {'minor disruptions': 'somewhat likely', 'moderate disruptions': 'likely', 'severe disruptions': 'somewhat unlikely'}
- grape price change: {'increase': 'somewhat likely', 'no change': 'likely', 'decrease': 'somewhat unlikely'}
- grape yield change: {'increase': 'somewhat unlikely', 'no change': 'somewhat likely', 'decrease': 'likely'}
- grapefruit price change: {'increase': 'likely', 'no change': 'somewhat likely', 'decrease': 'unlikely'}
- grapefruit yield change: {'increase': 'unlikely', 'no change': 'somewhat likely', 'decrease': 'very likely'}

Below, I have sampled a set of state-action pairs, wherein states are sampled from the state belief distribution you provided and actions are sampled uniformly from the action space. I would like to construct a utility function from your comparisons of state-action pairs

You should format your response as a JSON object. The JSON object should contain the following keys:
- decision: a string that describes the state-action pair you recommend the farmer to take. The output format should be the same as the format of the state-action pairs listed above, e.g. State-Action Pair 5.
- rank: a list of integers that ranks the state-action pairs in decreasing rank of preference. For example, if you think the first state-action pair is the most preferred, the second state-action pair is the second most preferred, and so on. For example, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
- explanation: a string that describes, in detail, the reasoning behind your decision. You should include information on the expected yield and price of each fruit, as well as factors that affect them.
