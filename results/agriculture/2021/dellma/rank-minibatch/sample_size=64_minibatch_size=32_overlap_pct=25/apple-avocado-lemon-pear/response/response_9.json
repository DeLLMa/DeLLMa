    "explanation": "the decision to recommend state-action pair 11, which involves planting avocados on 10 acres, is based on several factors. the state variables indicate a continued drought and minor supply chain disruptions, with an increase in avocado price and no change in avocado yield. given the high value of avocados and the increase in price, even with no change in yield, the profit potential is significant. additionally, avocados have a relatively high tolerance to drought conditions compared to other fruits, which is beneficial given the 'continued drought' condition. the average yield and price per unit for avocados in california are also favorable, with an average yield of 2.87 tons / acre and an average price per unit of 2,430 $ / ton, which is higher than the other fruits listed. the ranking of the state-action pairs takes into account the likelihood of price increases and stable yields for avocados, as well as the potential negative impacts of drought and supply chain disruptions on the other fruits. pairs involving avocados with favorable price and yield conditions are ranked higher, while those with decreased yields or prices for other fruits are ranked lower."
