    "explanation": "the decision-making process under uncertainty involves evaluating the potential outcomes of different actions given the probable future states. the utility function is constructed by comparing state-action pairs, considering the expected yield and price changes for each fruit, as well as external factors such as climate conditions and supply chain disruptions. the pairs are ranked based on the perceived utility, which combines the likelihood of positive price and yield changes with the resilience to negative external factors. state-action pair 13 is chosen as the optimal action because it represents a scenario with significant climate improvement, which is beneficial for peach production. additionally, the state indicates an increase in both peach price and yield, suggesting a higher profit potential. the other pairs are ranked in order of decreasing preference, with those showing favorable price and yield conditions for the chosen fruit and less severe external challenges being preferred. pairs with continued drought, severe supply chain disruptions, or likely decreases in yield and price are ranked lower due to the higher risk and potential for reduced profitability."
