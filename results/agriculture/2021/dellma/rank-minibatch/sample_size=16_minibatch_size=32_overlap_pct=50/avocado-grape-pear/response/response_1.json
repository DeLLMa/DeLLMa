    "explanation": "in making this decision, we must consider the expected yield and price for each fruit, as well as the impact of climate conditions and supply chain disruptions. the state-action pairs were ranked based on the likelihood of favorable conditions for yield and price increases, and the resilience of each fruit type to adverse conditions. avocado has a high price per ton and the market demand is strong, with the u.s. consumption increasing significantly. despite the likelihood of decreased yields due to continued drought, the increase in avocado prices makes it a potentially profitable crop. state-action pair 2 is chosen as the optimal action because it presents a scenario where avocado prices increase and supply chain disruptions are minor, which could lead to higher profits even with a decrease in yield. the other state-action pairs were ranked based on similar considerations, with preference given to scenarios with increased prices or improved conditions that could lead to higher profitability."
