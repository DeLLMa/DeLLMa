    "explanation": "the decision to recommend state-action pair 3 (planting avocados on 10 acres) is based on several factors that align with the state variables provided. the state in pair 3 indicates continued drought, which is very likely, and minor supply chain disruptions, which are somewhat likely. the price of avocados is expected to remain stable (no change), which is somewhat likely, and the yield is also expected to remain stable (no change), which is somewhat likely. this suggests that avocados may be a less risky option compared to other fruits that are expected to have yield decreases due to the drought conditions. additionally, the increase in avocado consumption and the high price per ton make it a lucrative option. the other state-action pairs were ranked based on the likelihood of positive outcomes for yield and price, with those having increased prices and stable or increased yields being more preferred. pairs with decreased yields and prices, or severe supply chain disruptions, were ranked lower due to the higher risk and potential for lower profitability."
