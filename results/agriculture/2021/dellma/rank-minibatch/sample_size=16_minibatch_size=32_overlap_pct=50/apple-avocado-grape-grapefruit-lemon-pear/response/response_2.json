    "explanation": "in making this decision, we must consider the expected yield and price changes for each fruit, as well as the impact of climate conditions and supply chain disruptions. the state-action pairs were ranked based on the likelihood of positive outcomes in terms of yield and price, as well as the resilience of the crop to adverse conditions such as drought and supply chain issues. avocado stands out as a strong candidate due to its high price per unit and the increasing trend in consumption and price, despite the potential decrease in yield. the selected state-action pair 2 indicates a scenario with continued drought and minor supply chain disruptions, which are manageable, and no change in avocado price and yield, which is favorable given the high value of the crop. the other state-action pairs were ranked accordingly, with preference given to those with stable or increasing prices and yields, and lower susceptibility to negative climate impacts and supply chain disruptions. pairs with decreases in both price and yield, or severe disruptions, were ranked lower due to the higher risk and potential for reduced profitability."
