    "explanation": "the decision-making under uncertainty framework requires us to consider the most probable outcomes based on the given state variables and their impact on the potential profitability of each crop. we need to consider both the expected yield and the expected price, which are influenced by climate conditions, supply chain disruptions, and market changes in price and yield for each fruit type. given the information provided, we should prioritize actions that are less likely to be negatively impacted by the forecasted conditions and have a higher expected price and yield. state-action pair 3 is recommended because it involves planting avocados, which have an expected price increase and are less sensitive to yield changes due to the high price per ton. additionally, the state indicates mild improvement in climate and severe supply chain disruptions, which may affect other fruits more severely than avocados. the order of preference is based on a combination of expected price increases and resilience to adverse conditions, with a focus on maximizing profit while minimizing risk.",
