    "decision": "action 3. lemon: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "given the current market conditions and the projected unknown factors, planting lemons appears to be the most profitable action. the usda report indicates that lemon production is at its lowest in five years, which has contributed to a 7 percent increase in grower prices. while the average yield for lemons is 428 boxes / acre with an average price of 23.3 $ / box, on tree equiv, the lower production levels suggest a strong market for lemons. with continued supply chain disruptions being very likely and increased labor costs also being very likely, lemons, which have a higher value per box compared to apples and grapefruits, may be less sensitive to these increases in costs. the likelihood of continued extreme weather events also favors lemons, as they are more adaptable to the california climate and less susceptible to heat damage compared to apples. despite the increased domestic competition being somewhat likely and increased international competition being likely, the reduced domestic production and lower exports for lemons indicate a strong domestic market. furthermore, the continued presence of diseases and pests is very likely, but lemons in california are currently less affected by diseases like citrus greening, which is more prevalent in grapefruit. the likely improvement in trade relations and decrease in tariffs may also benefit lemon exports in the future. considering all these factors, lemons present a higher potential for profit on your 10 acres of land in california."
