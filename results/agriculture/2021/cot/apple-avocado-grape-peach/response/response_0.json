    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "given the current market conditions and the potential unknown factors that could affect crop profitability, planting avocados appears to be the most advantageous decision. the average yield for avocados is 2.87 tons / acre and the average price per unit is 2,430 $ / ton, which is the highest among the options provided. despite the decrease in california avocado production due to wildfires and water restrictions, u.s. consumption has increased significantly, with a growing reliance on imports. this increase in demand, coupled with the high price per unit, suggests that domestic avocados could fetch a premium in the market. the likelihood of increased input costs and continued drought and water scarcity are concerning for all crops, but avocados have demonstrated resilience and high value in the face of these challenges. additionally, considering the somewhat likely possibility of supply chain disruptions, having a high-value crop that can withstand domestic market fluctuations is beneficial. the likelihood of continued extreme weather conditions and water scarcity also suggests that a crop with a higher per-unit value may be more risk-averse, as lower yields could still result in significant revenue. although technological advances are only somewhat likely to bring significant breakthroughs, incremental improvements could potentially help mitigate some of the risks associated with water usage and pest management for avocados."
