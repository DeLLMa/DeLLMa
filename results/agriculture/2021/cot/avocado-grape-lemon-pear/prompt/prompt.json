            "explanation": "based on the usda report and the estimated possibilities of the unknown factors affecting crop profitability, growing grapes seems to be the most viable option. the report indicates that grape production is forecasted to be up 9 percent from 2020, despite drought and heat conditions, suggesting that grapes are relatively resilient to some of the adverse weather conditions that california is experiencing. additionally, the average grape yield is 6.92 tons / acre with an average price per unit of 908 $ / ton, which provides a substantial revenue per acre. considering that water availability is very likely to become more restricted, grapes may be a better choice since they are known to be more drought-tolerant than some other fruit crops. moreover, the likelihood of increased input costs and higher labor costs suggests that crops with lower input requirements and less labor-intensive harvesting processes could be more profitable. grapes meet these criteria better than avocados, which have been heavily affected by water restrictions and wildfires, and lemons, which have seen a significant drop in production due to heat damage. pears have a lower average price per unit and are also forecasted to have a similar production level to the previous year, which may not be enough to offset the increased costs and labor issues. taking into account the likelihood of continued supply chain disruptions, a crop that can be stored and transported more easily, like grapes, might face fewer challenges in reaching the market. lastly, the moderate to likely chance of technological advances could benefit grape production through improved cultivation and harvesting methods."
