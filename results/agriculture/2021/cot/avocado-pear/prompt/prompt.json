            "explanation": "the decision to recommend planting avocados over pears is based on several factors outlined in the usda report and the estimated possibilities of unknown factors affecting crop production. firstly, the average yield and price statistics favor avocados, with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre and a high price of $2,430 per ton, compared to pears with a yield of 15.6 tons per acre but a significantly lower price of $565 per ton. despite the higher yield of pears, the substantial price difference makes avocados more profitable on a per-acre basis. additionally, the report indicates that u.s. avocado consumption is on the rise, with a significant increase in imports, suggesting strong market demand. while there is high import competition, particularly from mexico, the domestic demand for avocados remains robust, which may support domestic prices. the factors such as droughts, heat waves, and wildfires are very likely to occur and are a concern for both crops, but traditional pear trees' larger canopies may not provide enough of an advantage to outweigh the higher profitability of avocados. the cost of inputs is likely to increase, which could affect both crops, but the higher value per ton of avocados may better absorb these costs. water availability is a significant concern, with significant restrictions very likely, but this will impact both avocados and pears, and avocados' higher per-ton value might offer a better buffer against increased water costs. considering all these factors, avocados appear to be the more profitable option for the farmer's 10 acres of land in california."
