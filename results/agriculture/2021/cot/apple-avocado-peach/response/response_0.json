    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "given the current market conditions, agricultural trends, and the specific factors affecting crop production, planting avocados seems to be the most profitable option for several reasons. firstly, the average yield of avocados in california is 2.87 tons per acre, with a high price per unit of $2,430 per ton, which is significantly higher than the price per unit for apples and peaches. despite the challenges posed by water restrictions and potential wildfires, the demand for avocados in the u.s. has increased significantly, and the market is heavily reliant on imports, which suggests a strong domestic market for locally produced avocados. the likelihood of ongoing supply chain disruptions could also favor local production over imported goods. additionally, technological advancements and the somewhat likely stable labor availability and costs could help mitigate some of the production challenges. the very likely continued drought and water restrictions in california are a concern for all crops, but given the high value of avocados, the investment in water-efficient technologies and practices could be more easily justified. the likely increase in input costs for fertilizers, pesticides, and energy is a concern for all crops, but the higher return on avocados may help absorb these costs better than the other options. therefore, based on the expected yield, high price per unit, and the market conditions, planting avocados is recommended for maximizing profits on the 10 acres of land available."
