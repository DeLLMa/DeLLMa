    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "considering the various factors and their likelihoods, planting avocados appears to be the most profitable decision. despite the increased input costs, which are very likely, avocados have a high unit price ($2,430 per ton) and a reasonable yield (2.87 tons per acre), which can result in significant revenue. the likelihood of increased demand for avocados is high, and even though labor availability may decrease, the unchanged conditions are also likely, suggesting that labor issues may not significantly impact the avocado harvest. the potential for pest and disease pressure is somewhat likely, but this risk is present for all crops. regulatory changes are likely to remain the same or become more stringent, but avocados do not seem to be currently facing any specific regulatory threats that could impact production heavily. supply chain issues are somewhat likely to increase, but as the domestic demand for avocados is strong, reliance on export markets is less critical. technological advances, which are likely to be moderate, could help mitigate some of the challenges faced in avocado production. the very likely decrease in water availability is a concern, but avocados are a high-value crop that may justify the investment in efficient irrigation systems to cope with water scarcity. lastly, the somewhat likely occurrence of extreme weather events is a concern for all crops, but the high value of avocados may provide a buffer against potential yield losses due to weather impacts. therefore, with careful management, avocados are expected to provide the highest profitability on the 10 acres of land available."
