    "decision": "action 3. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "considering the various factors and the empirical likelihood of their occurrence, planting grapes seems to be the most viable option. the average grape yield in california is 6.92 tons / acre with an average price per unit of 908 $ / ton, which is a competitive yield and price combination. while there is a somewhat likely chance of increased import competition, the market demand for grapes is likely to increase, and the competition is expected to remain stable. given the ongoing drought, which is very likely to continue, grapes are a more drought-tolerant crop compared to options like avocados, which have a higher water demand. the cost of production is likely to increase moderately, but this is a factor across all crops. government policies and tariffs are likely to remain unchanged, which should not negatively impact the grape market. while weather conditions pose a risk with likely occasional extreme weather events, grapes have shown resilience in the 2021 season with a 9 percent increase in production despite drought and heat conditions. lastly, supply chain issues may cause minor disruptions, but this risk is present for all crops. therefore, given the high yield, favorable market conditions, and relatively lower water requirements, grapes are the recommended crop for maximizing profit on the 10 acres of land available."
