            "explanation": "based on the provided usda report and the empirical estimates of the possible factors affecting crop profitability, planting avocados seems to be the most promising option. the report indicates that u.s. avocado consumption has increased significantly, and despite the competition from imports, the domestic demand remains strong. the market demand for avocados is likely to continue increasing, which could support higher prices. moreover, the average price per unit for avocados is substantially higher at $2,430 per ton compared to apples ($0.244 per pound), lemons ($23.3 per box), and peaches ($763 per ton). although avocados are water-intensive and california is experiencing a drought, which could lead to water restrictions, the high price per unit might offset the costs associated with any increased expenses for water, should it be available. additionally, the input costs are expected to increase, which could have a greater impact on crops with lower returns per acre. the likelihood of extreme weather events must be considered, but this affects all crops, not just avocados. given the combination of high market demand, high unit price, and the possibility to manage water use more effectively for higher-value crops, avocados present a strong opportunity for maximizing profits on the 10 acres of land available."
