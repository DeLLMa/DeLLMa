It gives an overview of the fruit and nut market in the United States, with an additional focus on information pertaining to avocado, grape, grapefruit, lemon, peach.\n\nMarket Overview: the usda report indicates a general increase in u.s. production of major noncitrus fruits for 2021, with apples, grapes, peaches, cranberries, and sweet and tart cherries seeing a rise in production, while pear production is forecasted to decline. the impact of extreme weather events and california's ongoing drought on crop yields is uncertain. fruit and tree nut grower price indices remain high, with fluctuations throughout 2021. the consumer price index for fresh fruit also increased, suggesting higher retail prices. the northwest heat dome has introduced production uncertainty, particularly for tree fruits. the u.s. citrus season ended with declines in all commodities except california tangerines, and citrus prices are higher. tree nut supplies are forecasted to be down from the previous year's record, with smaller almond and walnut crops expected to increase grower prices. factors such as weather conditions, supply chain issues, and demand are influencing the market.\n\n- avocado:\n    - Product Summary: california avocado production has decreased, with wildfires and water restrictions impacting yields. however, u.s. avocado consumption has increased significantly, with imports from mexico and peru growing substantially. mexico dominates the u.s. avocado market, with imports peaking from may through july. peruvian imports compete during the summer months, traditionally a period of lower mexican imports.\n    - California Price and Yield Statistics: the average avocado yield is 2.87 TONS / ACRE and the average price per unit is 2,430 $ / TON.\n- grape:\n    - Product Summary: grape production is forecasted to be up 9 percent from 2020, despite drought and heat conditions. california table-type grape production is also expected to increase. high heat has affected the industry, with coachella valley shipments down and central california shipments up. imports from mexico, the main competitor, were down slightly, but overall shipments were higher in 2021 than the previous year.\n    - California Price and Yield Statistics: the average grape yield is 6.92 TONS / ACRE and the average price per unit is 908 $ / TON.\n- grapefruit:\n    - Product Summary: grapefruit production has been significantly affected by winter storm uri in texas, reducing the crop to half the volume predicted. florida continues to lead in grapefruit production, but the impact of citrus greening disease and decreased bearing acreage has led to lower production levels. with reduced domestic production, imports have increased, and the average price for grapefruit has risen.\n    - California Price and Yield Statistics: the average grapefruit yield is 457 BOXES / ACRE and the average price per unit is 24.33 $ / BOX, ON TREE EQUIV.\n- lemon:\n    - Product Summary: lemon production is at its lowest in five years, with a 6 percent decrease for the fresh market. both california and arizona saw smaller crops, with arizona experiencing a significant drop due to heat damage. despite lower domestic production, fresh lemon imports increased, and u.s. fresh lemon exports decreased. grower prices for lemons have risen by 7 percent.\n    - California Price and Yield Statistics: the average lemon yield is 428 BOXES / ACRE and the average price per unit is 23.3 $ / BOX, ON TREE EQUIV.\n- peach:\n    - Product Summary: peach production is forecasted to be up 13 percent from the previous year, potentially the largest crop since 2017. california, south carolina, and georgia all expect increases in production despite weather challenges. however, california's forecast for processing clingstone peaches is down 3 percent from the previous year.\n    - California Price and Yield Statistics: the average peach yield is 13.7 TONS / ACRE and the average price per unit is 763 $ / TON.\n\nI'm a farmer in California planning what fruit to plant next year.
