    "decision": "action 2. grape: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the usda report and the estimated possibilities of various factors affecting crop production, planting grapes appears to be the more profitable option for the following reasons: the grape production in california is forecasted to be up, with an average yield of 6.92 tons / acre and an average price per unit of 908 $ / ton. in comparison, avocado has a lower yield of 2.87 tons / acre and although the price per unit is higher at 2,430 $ / ton, the total revenue per acre for grapes is still higher. additionally, avocados require a lot of water, and with the very likely possibility of restricted water supply and likely severe water shortages, this could severely impact avocado yields. grapes, while still affected by drought, have historically been more resilient and can be cultivated using more water-efficient practices. extreme heat events are also likely, which have been shown to affect avocado yields more than grape yields. the labor shortages, which are likely, could impact both crops, but grapes are typically less labor-intensive than avocados, which require more hands-on management. furthermore, the high import competition, which is likely, affects avocados more due to significant imports from mexico and peru, whereas grape imports from mexico were down slightly. considering these factors, while both crops face challenges, the overall conditions and market trends suggest that investing in grape production is a safer and potentially more profitable action."
