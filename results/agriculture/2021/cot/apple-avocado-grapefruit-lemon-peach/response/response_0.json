    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "considering the various factors and their estimated probabilities, planting avocados seems to be the most prudent decision. the average yield for avocados in california is 2.87 tons per acre, and the average price per unit is $2,430 per ton, which is significantly higher compared to the other fruits. despite the lower yield in terms of volume when compared to some other fruits, the high price per ton of avocados makes it a lucrative option. additionally, u.s. avocado consumption has increased significantly, and with imports from mexico and peru growing, there is a strong market demand that is likely to continue. the likelihood of increased competition is a concern, but the demand trend appears to be strong enough to absorb additional supply. the ongoing drought and water restrictions are a serious concern for all crops, but avocados have historically been a profitable crop in water-scarce conditions when managed properly. with the possibility of increased input costs and labor costs, the high value of avocados may help to offset these higher expenses. the potential for drought and heatwaves, which are very likely according to your estimates, also suggests that a more drought-tolerant crop like avocado could be a more resilient choice. moreover, the shift towards organic and local trends, which is likely, could favor avocados if you can capitalize on these consumer preferences. given the high value of the crop and the market trends, avocados present a strong opportunity for maximizing profit on your 10 acres of land in california."
