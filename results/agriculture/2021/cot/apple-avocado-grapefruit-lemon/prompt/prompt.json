            "explanation": "based on the provided data and the empirical estimates of the possible factors, avocados seem to be the most profitable choice for several reasons. firstly, the average yield for avocados is 2.87 tons / acre with a high average price per unit of 2,430 $ / ton, which is substantially higher compared to the other fruits listed. secondly, despite the ongoing drought and water restrictions, avocado trees are relatively water-efficient compared to other fruit trees like citrus, and with the current trend of moderate restrictions on water being likely, avocados may fare better than other crops that are more water-intensive. thirdly, while there is very likely high import competition, the demand for avocados in the u.s. continues to rise, and domestic avocados can command a premium in the market, especially if marketed as locally grown. additionally, considering the somewhat likely occurrence of restrictive export market conditions, focusing on a crop with strong domestic demand like avocados could be advantageous. lastly, technological advances in agriculture, which are likely to occur, could help mitigate some of the challenges faced by avocado growers, such as water efficiency and pest management. although input costs are likely to increase moderately and labor availability might be a challenge, the high value of avocados could offset these costs. the other crops, while having their own advantages, face more significant challenges such as heat damage in the case of apples and lemons, and pest and disease issues for citrus fruits like grapefruits and lemons. therefore, planting avocados on the 10 acres of land appears to be the most prudent decision in terms of maximizing profit."
