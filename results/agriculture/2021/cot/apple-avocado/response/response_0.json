    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data and the estimated likelihood of various factors affecting crop production, planting avocados appears to be the more profitable option. although both apples and avocados are subject to risks such as labor costs, supply chain issues, and water availability, the key differentiators are the market dynamics and the current state of production for each crop. apples have seen an increase in production, which may lead to lower prices, especially if export markets remain sluggish. avocado production, on the other hand, has decreased due to wildfires and water restrictions, but u.s. consumption of avocados has significantly increased, indicating a strong domestic market. additionally, the average price per unit for avocados is substantially higher than that for apples ($2,430 per ton for avocados versus $0.244 per pound for apples). given that 1 ton is equivalent to 2,000 pounds, the price per pound for avocados is approximately $1.215, which is nearly five times the price per pound for apples. despite the lower yield of avocados per acre, the significantly higher price per unit should compensate and potentially lead to greater profitability per acre. furthermore, with the ongoing drought conditions in california, which are very likely to continue, avocados may be a better choice due to their ability to be cultivated in water-scarce conditions using drought-resistant varieties and efficient irrigation practices. the increased costs of water also suggest a crop with a higher return per unit water used is preferable. taking into account the increased international competition for apples and the fact that avocados have a growing market with substantial imports, focusing on a high-value crop like avocados that can meet domestic demand seems to be a prudent decision."
