            "explanation": "given the current market conditions and the estimated possibilities of various factors affecting crop profitability, planting peaches appears to be the more advantageous decision. the average yield for peaches is 13.7 tons per acre at $763 per ton, which could potentially result in higher revenue per acre compared to avocados, which have a lower yield of 2.87 tons per acre at $2,430 per ton. despite the higher price per ton for avocados, the significantly higher yield of peaches is likely to result in greater overall revenue for the 10-acre plot. additionally, the likelihood of increased competition from imports, particularly for avocados with mexico dominating the market, could suppress domestic avocado prices or market share. the increased volume and competitive pricing of imported avocados are noted as likely, which could lead to a more challenging market for domestic avocado producers. input costs are very likely to increase, which could impact both crops, but the higher yield of peaches may provide a better buffer against such increases. labor shortages are also likely, which could affect both crops, but the increased demand for healthy, fresh produce and the stable demand with seasonal fluctuations work in favor of peaches, especially given their larger forecasted production increase. the ongoing drought in california, which is very likely to continue, could affect water-intensive crops like avocados more severely than peaches. lastly, extreme weather events are somewhat likely, and while they can affect both crops, the higher yield potential for peaches offers a potential risk mitigation factor. therefore, considering all these factors, planting peaches is recommended for maximizing profit on the 10-acre land."
