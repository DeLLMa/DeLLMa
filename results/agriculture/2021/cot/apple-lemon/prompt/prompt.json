            "decision": "action 2. lemon: 10 acres",
            "explanation": "based on the usda report and the enumerated unknown factors, the recommended action is to plant lemons on 10 acres of land. the decision is influenced by several factors: first, the average yield for lemons is 428 boxes per acre with a high average price per unit of $23.3 per box, which is significantly higher than the average price per pound for apples at $0.244. although lemon production is at its lowest in five years, the decrease in domestic production and the rise in grower prices by 7 percent indicate a strong market for lemons with less supply potentially leading to higher prices. furthermore, the increased international competition and the likelihood of tightening global trade policies may affect apple exports more severely, as the report suggests that export markets for apples may remain sluggish. the rise in input costs is very likely, which could be more critical for apples since they might face a lower price per unit in the domestic market due to increased supply from reduced exports. water availability is a major concern in california, and lemons may require less water than apples, making them a more sustainable choice given the very likely continued or worsening drought conditions. lastly, the likelihood of extreme weather events could affect both crops, but the report indicates specific concern over heat damage for apples. considering all these factors, lemons appear to be the more profitable and less risky option for the coming year."
