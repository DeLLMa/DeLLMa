    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided data and the estimated likelihood of various unknown factors, planting avocados seems to be the most profitable option. the average yield for avocados in california is 2.87 tons per acre, and the average price per ton is $2,430. despite the very likely high level of imports for avocados, the u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, which could offset the competition from imports. additionally, market demand for healthy, fresh produce is likely to increase, which aligns well with the consumer trend towards avocados. while water availability is a significant concern, especially for a water-intensive crop like avocados, the high value of the crop may justify the investment in water-efficient technologies or practices. the ongoing drought conditions are very likely to continue, but avocados have historically been a high-value crop that can withstand some level of water scarcity with proper management. furthermore, the likelihood of continued challenges with citrus greening for grapefruit makes grapefruit a less attractive option. apple production is facing heat damage concerns, and pear production is forecasted to decline, which could impact profitability. considering these factors, avocados present a high-value opportunity with a strong market demand, despite the challenges related to water use and import competition."
