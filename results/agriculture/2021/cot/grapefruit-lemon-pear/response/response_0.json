    "decision": "action 2. lemon: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "considering the various factors and their probabilities, planting lemons appears to be the most prudent choice. the average yield for lemons is 428 boxes per acre with an average price of $23.3 per box. despite a decrease in production, the demand for lemons remains consistent, and prices have risen by 7%, indicating a strong market. the citrus greening issue is very likely to occur, particularly affecting grapefruit, which makes grapefruit a riskier choice. lemons, while also a citrus fruit, have not been specified as being as severely affected by this disease. pears have a lower yield of 15.6 tons per acre and a price of $565 per ton, which is less lucrative compared to lemons, and the market demand for pears is not as strong as for lemons. the ongoing drought and water scarcity in california are significant concerns, and lemons may be more drought-tolerant compared to other fruits. additionally, technological advancements in irrigation and pest control are likely, which could help mitigate some of the risks associated with lemon cultivation. given the high likelihood of increased input costs, a crop with a higher current market price like lemons could better absorb these costs. the potential for supply chain disruptions also suggests a focus on a crop with a strong domestic market to minimize reliance on exports. therefore, action 2, planting lemons, is recommended for maximizing profit on the 10 acres of land available."
