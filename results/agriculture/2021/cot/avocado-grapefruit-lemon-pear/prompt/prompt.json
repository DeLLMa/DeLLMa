            "explanation": "based on the information provided, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton and a yield of 2.87 tons per acre. multiplying the yield by the price per unit gives us $6,973.10 per acre, which is the highest potential revenue per acre among the options. even though there is high import competition, the demand for avocados has increased significantly, and domestic consumption remains strong. additionally, technological advances and moderate water restrictions are likely, which could potentially mitigate the impact of increased input costs and water availability issues. while weather conditions and global economic conditions pose a risk, the high price and strong market demand for avocados suggest that this crop is the most profitable option for the 10 acres of land available. pear production, while having a lower price per unit, is stable, but the potential revenue per acre is significantly less than that of avocados. grapefruit and lemon both have lower yields and prices per unit compared to avocados, and they also face challenges such as citrus greening disease and heat damage, which could further impact their profitability."
