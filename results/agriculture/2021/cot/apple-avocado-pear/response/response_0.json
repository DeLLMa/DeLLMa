    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "after considering the various factors and their likelihood, planting avocados seems to be the most profitable choice for the following reasons: the average yield for avocados is 2.87 tons per acre, and the price per ton is the highest among the options at $2,430. despite the decrease in california avocado production, u.s. consumption has increased significantly, which is a positive indicator for market demand. avocados also have a growing import market from mexico and peru, which suggests a strong and expanding market. although labor availability is a concern, the high price per unit for avocados may offset higher labor costs. the increased tariffs and trade barriers could affect apples more due to their export market reliance, making avocados a safer choice domestically. weather conditions are a concern for all crops, but the report does not specify avocados being as negatively impacted by the heat dome as apples. pears have a lower price per unit and are experiencing production declines, making them a less attractive option. while input costs are likely to increase, the high price per unit for avocados should provide a buffer against this. technological advancements could potentially benefit all crops, but avocados might have a better margin to incorporate such advancements due to their higher profitability. finally, consumer trends towards healthy eating are likely to continue supporting demand for avocados. therefore, despite the risks, the high value and growing demand for avocados make them the most promising option for maximizing profit on your 10 acres of land in california."
