            "explanation": "based on the usda report and the estimated possibilities of the unknown factors affecting crop production and profitability, it is advisable to plant peaches on the 10 acres of land. the report suggests that peach production is forecasted to be up 13 percent from the previous year, potentially making it the largest crop since 2017. the average peach yield is 13.7 tons per acre with an average price of $763 per ton, which is a substantial yield and a good market price. in contrast, lemon production is at its lowest in five years with a 6 percent decrease for the fresh market, and the average yield is 428 boxes per acre with an average price of $23.3 per box. while grower prices for lemons have risen by 7 percent, the increase in peach production and the higher price per unit weight make peaches appear to be the more profitable option. additionally, the likelihood of severe water restrictions is very high, and peaches may require less water than lemons, making them a more suitable choice given the ongoing drought conditions in california. the somewhat likely increase in demand for lemons and peaches, along with the likely stable demand, suggests that market conditions could be favorable for peach sales. although input costs are very likely to increase and labor shortages are likely, these factors will affect both crops similarly. therefore, the decision to plant peaches is based on their higher expected profitability in the current market and agricultural conditions."
