            "explanation": "based on the usda report and the enumerated unknown factors, planting avocados seems to be the most profitable decision. the average yield for avocados in california is 2.87 tons / acre with an average price per unit of 2,430 $ / ton, which is significantly higher than the other fruits mentioned. additionally, u.s. avocado consumption has increased significantly, and despite the decrease in california's production due to wildfires and water restrictions, there is a strong market demand for avocados, likely driven by consumer preferences for healthy foods. considering the likely increase in input costs and labor costs, avocados still present a high-value crop that could absorb these costs better than the other options. the ongoing drought and water restrictions are a concern for all crop choices, but avocados have a higher return per unit of water used compared to the other crops listed. global trade dynamics and supply chain issues are less of a concern for avocados since the u.s. market relies heavily on imports, and domestic production is not meeting current demand, which could insulate domestic prices from international competition to some extent. while pest and disease pressure and weather conditions are somewhat likely to increase, the high value of avocados may justify the investment in protective measures. given these considerations, avocados appear to offer the best potential for maximizing profits on your 10 acres of land in california."
