    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report and the empirical estimates of possible factors affecting crop production and profitability, planting avocados appears to be the most profitable action. the average yield for avocados in california is 2.87 tons per acre, with a high average price of $2,430 per ton. despite decreased production due to wildfires and water restrictions, u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, and the market is heavily supplied by imports, which suggests a continued strong demand. the likelihood of increased demand for healthy/organic produce supports the decision to plant avocados, which are perceived as a healthy food choice. additionally, avocados are less likely to be affected by the heat waves, as they are more tolerant of heat compared to some other crops. the tightening of trade relations and potential supply chain issues may also favor locally grown avocados over imported ones. while water availability is a very likely concern, avocados are relatively water-efficient compared to other high-water-demand crops, and technological advancements may provide some improvements in water use efficiency. the increase in input costs and labor costs are concerns for all crops, but the high unit price of avocados may help absorb these costs better. therefore, despite the risks, the high market value and strong demand for avocados make them a promising crop for maximizing profit on your 10 acres of land in california."
