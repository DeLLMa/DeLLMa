    "decision": "action 2. lemon: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "considering the usda report and the estimated likelihood of various factors affecting crop profitability, lemons appear to be the more profitable choice for the following reasons: the average yield for grapes is 6.92 tons per acre at $908 per ton, which would result in $6,283.36 per acre. for lemons, the average yield is 428 boxes per acre at $23.3 per box, equating to $9,973.4 per acre. despite the lower production of lemons in recent years, the increased grower prices and the fact that lemons are at the lowest production in five years could mean less competition and higher prices for your lemons. additionally, lemons have seen a 7 percent increase in grower prices, indicating a strong market for lemons despite the production decrease. the increased domestic competition and international competition for grapes, along with the impact of extreme weather events, could lead to greater production uncertainty for grapes. on the other hand, while the water availability issue is a concern for both crops, grapes may be more susceptible to drought conditions and heat, as indicated by the variable shipments due to high heat. the ongoing drought in california is more likely to affect water-intensive crops like grapes. labor costs are also likely to increase, which could affect both crops, but the higher revenue per acre of lemons may help to offset these costs better than grapes. finally, given the ongoing supply chain issues, the proximity to markets and the ability to sell the crop at a good price is crucial, and lemons seem to have a more favorable position in this regard. therefore, despite the risks and potential challenges, lemons currently have a higher per-acre value and may offer better potential for maximizing profit on your 10 acres of land in california."
