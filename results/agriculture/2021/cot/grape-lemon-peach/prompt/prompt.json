            "explanation": "considering the usda report and the unknown factors with their likelihoods, grape production seems to be the most promising choice. the report suggests that grape production is forecasted to be up 9 percent from 2020, and despite drought and heat conditions, california table-type grape production is expected to increase. the average yield for grapes is 6.92 tons per acre with a high average price of $908 per ton, which is a strong indicator of profitability. additionally, while competition from mexico is down slightly, overall shipments were higher in 2021 than the previous year, suggesting a strong market presence for u.s. grapes. the likelihood of increased input costs and labor costs is concerning; however, the higher price per unit for grapes may help offset these increases. water availability is a very likely issue but given that grapes are traditionally more drought-tolerant than other fruits, this might not be as detrimental to grape production compared to other crops. the likelihood of continued extreme weather events and supply chain disruptions are also factors to consider, but these will impact all crop choices, not just grapes. given the high value per unit and the increasing production trend despite adverse conditions, grape production appears to be the most viable option among the three presented."
