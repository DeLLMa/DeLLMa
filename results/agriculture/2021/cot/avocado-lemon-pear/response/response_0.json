    "decision": "action 1. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the information provided, avocados have the highest average price per unit at $2,430 per ton with an average yield of 2.87 tons per acre, which would result in an estimated revenue of $69,681 per acre (2.87 tons/acre * $2,430/ton). despite the decrease in california avocado production due to wildfires and water restrictions, the u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, and there is a strong import market to support demand. with the high grower price index and consumer price index for fresh fruit, the profitability of avocados is promising. furthermore, the ongoing drought and heat waves, which are very likely to continue, may affect water-intensive crops like avocados less than other options, as avocados are relatively drought-tolerant and can produce viable yields with efficient water management practices. the likelihood of increased input costs and labor costs also favors avocados, as higher returns per acre may better absorb these costs. the continued water restrictions and scarcity, which are very likely, will also impact all crops, but the high value of avocados may justify the investment in water-efficient technologies and practices. the market demand for healthy fruits like avocados is likely to increase, and with stable pest and disease pressure, the risk to avocado crops is manageable. regulatory changes are likely to increase, but given the high value of the crop, it may be possible to adapt to new regulations more easily than with lower-value crops. although supply chain issues are somewhat likely to continue, the strong domestic market for avocados may mitigate some of these risks. lastly, technological advancements in agriculture, which are likely to continue at a steady pace, may further improve efficiency and yields for avocado production."
