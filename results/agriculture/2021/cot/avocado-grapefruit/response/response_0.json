    "decision": "action 2. grapefruit: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "given the current market conditions and the estimated likelihood of various factors affecting crop production and profitability, grapefruit appears to be the more stable option for planting on your 10 acres of land in california. the usda report and your own estimates suggest that while avocado consumption and prices are high, the production is heavily impacted by water restrictions and wildfires, which are likely to continue. with severe water restrictions being likely and avocados requiring a lot of water, the risk of crop failure or reduced yields for avocados is higher. additionally, increased competition from imports is very likely, which could further pressure domestic avocado prices and market share. on the other hand, grapefruit production has been affected by winter storms and disease, but the market has responded with higher prices for domestic grapefruit, and there is a likelihood of stable demand. while disease and pests are a concern for grapefruit as well, the occasional occurrence is very likely, and an outbreak is only likely, not certain. economic conditions are expected to be stable, which should support consistent consumer spending on fresh produce like grapefruit. input costs are likely to increase, but this will affect both crops similarly. labor issues are likely to present challenges, but again, this will impact both crops. supply chain issues are likely or very likely, but given the higher average price per unit for grapefruit and the higher resilience to water shortages, grapefruit is a safer bet. weather conditions pose a risk, but this is true for both crops, and grapefruits have not been singled out as being at particular risk from the heat dome as tree fruits have. therefore, considering the higher price per unit for grapefruit and the potential for a more stable production environment, grapefruit is the recommended crop for maximizing profit on your land under the current conditions."
