            "explanation": "taking into account the provided data and the estimated likelihood of various factors, planting grapes seems to be the more profitable option for the following reasons: firstly, the grape production in california is forecasted to be up from the previous year despite the challenging conditions, indicating a resilient crop. the average yield for grapes is 6.92 tons per acre with an average price of $908 per ton, which could result in a substantial revenue per acre. in contrast, while apple production is up 3 percent from 2020/21, there is concern over heat damage, and export markets may remain sluggish, potentially lowering domestic prices. the average yield for apples is 19,000 lb per acre with an average price of $0.244 per lb, which is less lucrative compared to grapes when considering the total expected revenue per acre. additionally, the increased competition and likelihood of supply chain disruptions could more negatively impact the apple market, which relies more heavily on exports. the very likely increase in input costs and the very likely reduced water availability are critical concerns for both crops, but grapes may have a slight edge due to their ability to better withstand drought conditions. considering the likely stable or increasing market demand for grapes and the somewhat likely higher pest and disease pressure, which could be more detrimental to apples, grapes present a more favorable option. lastly, the likely occurrence of weather extremes could affect both crops, but the recent resilience shown by grape production under such conditions offers a degree of confidence. therefore, based on the expected yield, price, and the assessed risk factors, planting grapes on 10 acres is recommended."
