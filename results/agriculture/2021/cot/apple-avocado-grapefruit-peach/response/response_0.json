    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the usda report and the estimated likelihood of the unknown factors, planting avocados seems to be the most profitable option. the average yield for avocados is 2.87 tons / acre with a high price per unit of 2,430 $ / ton. despite the decrease in california avocado production due to wildfires and water restrictions, the u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, and this trend is likely to continue with 'increasing demand' being likely. the high competition from imports is very likely, but given the strong market demand and high prices, domestic avocados still have a competitive edge. the moderate to high consumer price sensitivity is also less of a concern for avocados given their strong market demand and the fact that avocado consumers are often willing to pay a premium for locally grown produce. furthermore, technological advances that are likely to occur could potentially mitigate some of the negative impacts of disease, pests, and input costs on avocado production. while weather conditions pose a risk, this is a factor for all crops, and the high value of avocados may justify the risk. additionally, avocados are not mentioned as being directly affected by the northwest heat dome, unlike apples. given these considerations, avocados present a high-value crop with strong market demand, which could maximize profits on your 10 acres of land in california."
