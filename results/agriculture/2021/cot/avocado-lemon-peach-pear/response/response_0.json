    "decision": "action 1. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "given the various factors and their likelihoods, the decision to plant avocados seems the most promising for maximizing profit. the average yield for avocados is 2.87 tons/acre with a high average price of 2,430 $/ton, which indicates a potentially high revenue per acre. despite the decrease in california avocado production, u.s. consumption has increased significantly, and the market is heavily reliant on imports. this presents an opportunity for domestic growth, especially with very likely increased demand for healthy produce. while water scarcity is a very likely issue, avocados are relatively drought-tolerant compared to other fruits, and efficient water management practices can be implemented to mitigate this risk. the likelihood of increased international competition is a concern; however, the high demand for avocados and the premium price for locally grown produce may offset this. the increased sensitivity to price changes due to an economic downturn is a risk, but the very likely increase in demand for fresh, local produce may balance this out. given the increased labor costs, avocados may still be a good choice as they are less labor-intensive to harvest compared to fruits that require more delicate handling, like peaches and pears. considering all these factors, avocados appear to offer a favorable balance of high market value, increasing consumer demand, and adaptability to challenging growing conditions."
