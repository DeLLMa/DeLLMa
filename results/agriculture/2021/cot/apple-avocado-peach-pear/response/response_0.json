    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the provided usda report and the estimation of unknown factors, the recommended action is to plant avocados. the report shows that while california avocado production has decreased, u.s. consumption has increased significantly, with a strong reliance on imports. this implies a robust domestic market for avocados which may lead to favorable prices for locally produced avocados. additionally, the average price per unit for avocados is the highest among the listed fruits at $2,430 per ton, and the yield is 2.87 tons per acre, which would result in a high return per acre even if the total yield is not the highest. considering the very likely increase in input costs, the high value of avocados may help offset these costs better than other fruits. the somewhat likely increase in water restrictions and the very likely continuation of drought and extreme weather conditions suggest that a crop with a higher value per unit of water used may be more profitable. avocados, while water-intensive, have a high price that can justify the water use in economic terms. moreover, labor availability issues and supply chain disruptions may be less impactful on a high-value crop like avocados, where the margins could absorb some additional costs. lastly, the market for avocados seems stable to somewhat likely to increase in demand, which is favorable compared to the more uncertain market conditions for apples, peaches, and pears."
