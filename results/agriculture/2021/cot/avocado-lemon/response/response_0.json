    "decision": "action 2. lemon: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "based on the usda report and the estimated possibilities of various factors occurring, it seems more prudent to plant lemons over avocados. while both crops are subject to similar risks such as water availability, labor costs, and weather conditions, the key differentiators are the market dynamics and profitability potential. avocado production has decreased due to wildfires and water restrictions, and there is very likely an increase in import volume and competitive pricing from mexico and peru, which could suppress domestic avocado prices. the increase in input costs, which is very likely, would also affect avocados more due to their higher water needs. lemons, although experiencing a decrease in production, have seen grower prices rise by 7 percent, indicating a strong market value despite increased imports. the average yield for lemons is 428 boxes per acre, with a price of $23.3 per box, while avocados yield 2.87 tons per acre, with a price of $2,430 per ton. when calculated, the revenue per acre for lemons is approximately $9,972.4, and for avocados, it is approximately $6,974.1. given that the market demand for lemons is stable and the increase in grower prices, despite lower production volumes, lemons present a more favorable option. additionally, with the likelihood of continued drought and water restrictions being very high, lemons may fare better as they are less water-intensive than avocados. therefore, taking into account the current market conditions and the various risk factors, planting lemons would be the recommended action to maximize profit on the 10 acres of land."
