            "explanation": "given the current market conditions and the potential unknown factors, planting lemons appears to be the most prudent choice. the usda report indicates that lemon production is at its lowest in five years, which has led to a 7 percent increase in grower prices. despite the decrease in domestic production, there's an increase in imports and a decrease in exports, but the higher grower prices suggest a strong domestic market that could absorb the production from your 10 acres. the average yield for lemons in california is 428 boxes per acre, and the average price per unit is $23.3 per box, which is a relatively high value per unit compared to apples and avocados. additionally, considering the very likely continued dominance of mexican and peruvian imports in the avocado market, it would be challenging to compete with imported avocados. while apple production is up, the market faces uncertainties due to the northwest heat dome and potential over-supply in the domestic market if export markets remain sluggish, which could lower prices. moreover, considering the likely increase in input costs, labor costs, and the very likely continued drought leading to water scarcity, lemons, which are less water-intensive than avocados, would likely have a lower cost of production relative to potential revenue. therefore, the combination of high unit prices, lower production costs, and the current market dynamics makes lemons the most favorable option among the three."
