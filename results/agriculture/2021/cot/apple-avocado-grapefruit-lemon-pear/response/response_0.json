    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "considering the provided data and the estimated likelihood of various factors, planting avocados seems to be the most profitable option. the average yield for avocados is 2.87 tons per acre with a high average price of $2,430 per ton. despite the concerns over water availability, which is very likely to continue due to california's drought conditions, avocados still present a high-value crop that can maximize profits on the 10 acres of land. while there is an increased demand for locally-grown and organic produce, avocados are a popular fruit with significant consumption growth in the u.s. the risk of disease and pests is present for all crops, but the impact on avocados is not specified as being more severe than for other fruits. input costs are likely to increase, which may affect profit margins, but the high unit price of avocados can help absorb some of these costs. labor shortages could be a concern; however, the profitability per acre of avocados may justify the higher labor costs. market fluctuations do pose a risk, yet the strong domestic demand for avocados and the challenges of importing them may benefit local producers. policy changes and supply chain issues are somewhat likely to occur but are not specific to avocados and will impact all crops similarly. technological advances could potentially improve efficiency and yields, which would be beneficial if they materialize. lastly, while weather conditions pose a risk to all crops, avocados have not been specifically mentioned as being adversely affected by the recent extreme weather events to the same extent as other fruits, such as apples and citrus. therefore, based on the available information, avocados appear to offer the best potential for profit on your farm."
