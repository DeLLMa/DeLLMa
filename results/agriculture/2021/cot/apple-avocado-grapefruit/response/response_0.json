    "decision": "action 2. avocado: 10 acres",
    "explanation": "after considering the various factors and their likelihood, the decision to plant avocados seems to be the most profitable. the average yield of avocados in california is 2.87 tons per acre, with a high price per unit of $2,430 per ton. despite the potential for water restrictions due to ongoing drought, the market demand for avocados is increasing, which is a positive sign for potential sales. additionally, while there is very likely high import competition, the u.s. consumption of avocados has increased significantly, indicating a robust market. technological advancements, which are likely to occur, may also help offset some of the water availability issues and improve yield. although the cost of production is likely to increase moderately, the high unit price of avocados can help maintain profitability. the impact of disease and pests is only somewhat likely to be high, suggesting that with proper management, this risk can be mitigated. lastly, while weather conditions pose a risk, the somewhat likely occurrence of extreme events must be weighed against the high demand and price per unit for avocados, making it a worthwhile investment."
