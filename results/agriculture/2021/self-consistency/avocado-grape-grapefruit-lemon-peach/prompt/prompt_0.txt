Market Overview: the usda report indicates a general increase in u.s. production of major noncitrus fruits for 2021, with apples, grapes, peaches, cranberries, and sweet and tart cherries seeing a rise in production, while pear production is forecasted to decline. the impact of extreme weather events and california's ongoing drought on crop yields is uncertain. fruit and tree nut grower price indices remain high, with fluctuations throughout 2021. the consumer price index for fresh fruit also increased, suggesting higher retail prices. the northwest heat dome has introduced production uncertainty, particularly for tree fruits. the u.s. citrus season ended with declines in all commodities except california tangerines, and citrus prices are higher. tree nut supplies are forecasted to be down from the previous year's record, with smaller almond and walnut crops expected to increase grower prices. factors such as weather conditions, supply chain issues, and demand are influencing the market.

    - California Price and Yield Statistics: the average avocado yield is 2.87 TONS / ACRE and the average price per unit is 2,430 $ / TON.
- grape:
    - Product Summary: grape production is forecasted to be up 9 percent from 2020, despite drought and heat conditions. california table-type grape production is also expected to increase. high heat has affected the industry, with coachella valley shipments down and central california shipments up. imports from mexico, the main competitor, were down slightly, but overall shipments were higher in 2021 than the previous year.
