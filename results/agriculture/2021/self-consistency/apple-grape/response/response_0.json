            "explanation": "based on the provided usda report, grape production is forecasted to be up 9 percent from 2020, and despite the drought and heat conditions, california table-type grape production is expected to increase. this suggests a favorable growing condition and market for grapes. in contrast, although apple production is forecasted to be up 3 percent from the previous year, there is concern over heat damage in washington state, which could be indicative of potential heat-related issues in california as well. export markets for apples are sluggish, which may push more apples into the domestic market and lower prices. additionally, processing prices for apples might rise due to declines in other states, which does not directly benefit fresh apple growers in california. when we calculate the revenue per acre for both fruits, we find that grapes yield an average of 6.92 tons/acre with an average price of 908 $/ton, while apples yield an average of 19,000 lb/acre with an average price of 0.244 $/lb. converting pounds to tons for apples (1 ton = 2000 lb), the apple yield is approximately 9.5 tons/acre. the revenue per acre for each fruit is therefore: grapes: 6.92 tons/acre * 908 $/ton = 6281.76 $/acre. apples: 9.5 tons/acre * (0.244 $/lb * 2000 lb/ton) = 4634 $/acre. with grapes yielding a higher estimated revenue per acre than apples, and considering the market conditions, action 2, planting 10 acres of grapes, is the recommended decision to maximize profit."

            "explanation": "based on the provided usda report and the california price and yield statistics, we can calculate the expected revenue from both crops on a 10-acre land. for apples, with an average yield of 19,000 lb per acre and a price of 0.244 $/lb, the expected revenue per acre would be 19,000 lb * 0.244 $/lb = 4,636 $/acre. for 10 acres, this would be 46,360 $. for grapes, with an average yield of 6.92 tons per acre and a price of 908 $/ton, the expected revenue per acre would be 6.92 tons * 908 $/ton = 6,282.56 $/acre. for 10 acres, this would be 62,825.6 $. given these calculations, grapes are expected to yield a higher revenue per acre than apples. additionally, the report indicates that grape production is forecasted to be up from the previous year despite drought and heat conditions, suggesting a resilient and potentially profitable crop. while the apple market faces concerns over heat damage as well as potentially lower prices due to increased domestic supply and sluggish export markets, grape production is expected to increase, and high heat has not uniformly affected the industry. therefore, based on the expected higher revenue and market conditions, i recommend planting grapes on the 10 acres of land."

            "explanation": "based on the usda report and the provided yield and price statistics for california, we can calculate the expected revenue from planting apples versus grapes. for apples, the average yield is 19,000 pounds per acre at a price of $0.244 per pound. for grapes, the average yield is 6.92 tons per acre, with a ton being 2,000 pounds, at a price of $908 per ton. calculating the revenue per acre for each: apples: 19,000 lb/acre * $0.244/lb = $4,636/acre. grapes: 6.92 tons/acre * 2,000 lb/ton * $908/ton = $12,565.76/acre. multiplying by 10 acres, we get $46,360 for apples and $125,657.60 for grapes. the grape production offers a significantly higher potential revenue per acre compared to apples. despite the concerns over drought and heat, the grape production is forecasted to be up, and the prices are also favorable. although there's an increase in apple production, the market is facing potential price lowering due to sluggish export markets and possible oversupply in the domestic market. therefore, the recommended action is to plant grapes on the 10 acres of land, as it is expected to maximize profit based on the current market data."

            "explanation": "based on the given data, planting grapes is expected to be more profitable than planting apples. the average grape yield in california is 6.92 tons per acre, with an average price of $908 per ton. if we calculate the revenue per acre for grapes, it would be 6.92 tons * $908/ton = $6,283.36 per acre. for 10 acres, the expected revenue would be approximately $62,833.60. in contrast, the average apple yield is 19,000 lbs per acre, and the average price is $0.244 per lb. the revenue per acre for apples would then be 19,000 lbs * $0.244/lb = $4,636 per acre. for 10 acres, the expected revenue would be approximately $46,360. additionally, the report indicates that grape production is forecasted to be up despite challenging conditions, and the shipments of grapes have been higher in 2021 than the previous year. on the other hand, while apple production is also forecasted to be up, there is concern over heat damage and potential price reductions due to increased domestic supply resulting from sluggish export markets. therefore, planting grapes is recommended for maximizing profit on the 10 acres of land."
